You are absolutely correct: when two waves mix nonlinearly, their interaction can produce additional frequencies that are the **sum** and **difference** of the original frequencies. This phenomenon is called **heterodyning** or **frequency mixing**, and it's commonly encountered in nonlinear systems like radio communications or optics.

In our example, the sum and difference frequencies should arise if there is a **nonlinear interaction** between the waves, such as through multiplication (not just addition). Let's revisit the system and explicitly introduce a nonlinear mixing term to observe the sum and difference frequencies.

### Steps to Include Nonlinear Mixing
1. The original combination was a linear superposition:
   \[
   \text{Combined Signal} = \text{Red Laser} + \text{Blue Laser}
   \]
   This does not generate sum and difference frequencies because it's purely additive.

2. To observe sum and difference frequencies, we need to consider the **product** of the two waves:
   \[
   \text{Mixed Signal} = \text{Red Laser} \times \text{Blue Laser}
   \]
   Using trigonometric identities:
   \[
   \cos(2\pi f_{\text{red}} t) \cos(2\pi f_{\text{blue}} t) = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \cos(2\pi(f_{\text{red}} + f_{\text{blue}})t) + \cos(2\pi(f_{\text{red}} - f_{\text{blue}})t) \right]
   \]
   This produces the sum and difference frequencies explicitly.

Let me compute and plot this!

In the graph above, we observe the **amplitude spectrum** for the nonlinear mixing of the red and blue laser signals. Key features include:

1. **Sum Frequency**:
   - A new frequency component appears at the sum of the red and blue laser frequencies (\(f_{\text{red}} + f_{\text{blue}}\)).
   - This corresponds to the higher-frequency oscillation generated by the interaction of the two waves.

2. **Difference Frequency**:
   - Another new frequency component appears at the difference between the red and blue laser frequencies (\(f_{\text{blue}} - f_{\text{red}}\)).
   - This corresponds to a lower-frequency beat signal resulting from the mixing.

### Why the Sum and Difference Frequencies Now Appear
The product of the two waves introduces **nonlinear interaction**, which is necessary for generating these mixed frequencies. In contrast, a simple addition of the waves only retains their original frequencies.

This illustrates how nonlinear effects create additional spectral components, a principle used in applications like:
- **Modulation** (e.g., AM/FM radio),
- **Optics** (e.g., sum-frequency generation in lasers),
- **Signal Processing** (e.g., beat detection).
