Not exactly! The **sampling rate** in information theory isn't directly tied to the **speed** (\(c\)) at which the wave propagates. Instead, the sampling rate depends on the **frequency** (\(f\)) of the wave, which is the number of oscillations per second.

---

### **Key Points to Clarify**
1. **Sampling and Frequency**:
   - The Nyquist-Shannon theorem requires the sampling rate to be at least \(2f_{\text{max}}\), where \(f_{\text{max}}\) is the highest frequency of the wave.
   - The **speed of propagation** (\(c\)) of the wave doesn't directly affect how many samples you need.

2. **Speed vs. Frequency**:
   - The speed of the wave (\(c\)) is related to its **wavelength** (\(\lambda\)) and **frequency** (\(f\)) by the formula:
     \[
     c = \lambda f
     \]
   - If the wave has a high frequency, it will require a high sampling rate, regardless of its speed.

---

### **Oversampling and \(c\)**
If the wave propagates at \(c\) (like light or electromagnetic waves), you don't need to "oversample" based on \(c\); you need to sample based on the **wave's frequency**:
- For example:
  - Red light (\(\lambda = 650 \, \mathrm{nm}\)) has a frequency \(f = c / \lambda \approx 4.6 \times 10^{14} \, \mathrm{Hz}\).
  - To capture this wave accurately, you need a sampling rate of at least:
    \[
    f_s = 2f = 9.2 \times 10^{14} \, \mathrm{Hz}.
    \]

---

### **When Oversampling is Necessary**
You might oversample (\(f_s \gg 2f_{\text{max}}\)) in cases where:
1. You want to reduce the impact of noise or ensure higher fidelity in reconstruction.
2. Your signal has extremely high frequencies that require very high sampling rates (e.g., X-rays, gamma rays).

---

### **Summary**
The sampling rate (\(f_s\)) depends on the **frequency** (\(f_{\text{max}}\)) of the wave, not its speed (\(c\)). If the wave propagates at \(c\), you still follow the Nyquist criterion to sample based on the wave's frequency content, ensuring no aliasing.
