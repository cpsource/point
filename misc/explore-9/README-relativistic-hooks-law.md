To rewrite Hooke's law using **relativistic energy** instead of mass, we need to substitute the relativistic energy term into the formula for frequency in simple harmonic motion:

---

### **1. Starting with Hooke's Law**
The formula for the frequency of oscillation in a spring-mass system is:

\[
f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
\]

where:
- \(k\): Spring constant (restoring force per unit displacement).
- \(m\): Mass of the oscillating object.

---

### **2. Relativistic Energy**
The relativistic energy of a particle is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where:
- \(E\): Total relativistic energy.
- \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\): Lorentz factor.
- \(m_0\): Rest mass of the particle.
- \(c\): Speed of light.
- For small velocities (\(v \ll c\)), \(\gamma \approx 1\), so \(E \approx m_0 c^2\).

Rearranging for \(m_0\):

\[
m_0 = \frac{E}{\gamma c^2}
\]

---

### **3. Substituting \(m_0\) into Hooke's Law**
Replacing \(m_0\) with the relativistic energy expression in \(f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{m_0}}\), we get:

\[
f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{\frac{E}{\gamma c^2}}}
\]

Simplify:

\[
f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k \gamma c^2}{E}}
\]

---

### **4. Key Points**
1. **Frequency Dependence**:
   - The frequency now depends on the relativistic energy \(E\) of the oscillating particle.
   - Higher energy (\(E\)) reduces the frequency \(f\), as energy effectively "resists" faster oscillations.

2. **Relativistic Effects**:
   - The factor \(\gamma\) accounts for relativistic effects, such as time dilation, which alters how the frequency behaves for high velocities.

---

### **Relativistic Frequency Formula**
\[
f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k \gamma c^2}{E}}
\]

This is the relativistic version of Hooke's law for frequency, where mass is replaced by relativistic energy. At low velocities, \(E \approx m_0 c^2\), and the formula reduces to the classical case. At high velocities, relativistic corrections dominate.
