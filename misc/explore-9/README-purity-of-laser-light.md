The **purity** of a laser beam, such as a red laser, is typically described in terms of its **linewidth** (the range of wavelengths or frequencies around the central wavelength) and the **stability** of its power output. Letâ€™s break it down:

---

### **1. Laser Linewidth**
The emission of laser light is not perfectly monochromatic. Instead, it has a small spread around its central wavelength or frequency:
- For a **red laser** (\(\lambda \approx 650 \, \mathrm{nm}\)), typical linewidths can vary depending on the type of laser:
  - **Gas Lasers** (e.g., He-Ne lasers): Linewidths are extremely narrow, often on the order of \(10^{-3} \, \mathrm{nm}\) (\(10 \, \mathrm{GHz}\)).
  - **Diode Lasers**: Linewidths are broader, typically \(0.01\) to \(0.1 \, \mathrm{nm}\) (\(10^9\) to \(10^{10} \, \mathrm{Hz}\)).

---

### **2. Power Stability**
The emitted power of a laser often fluctuates slightly over time, usually following a **Gaussian distribution**:
- **Mean Power (\(\mu\))**:
  - Typical red lasers (e.g., low-power diode lasers) emit around \(1 \, \mathrm{mW}\) to \(10 \, \mathrm{mW}\).
- **Standard Deviation (\(\sigma\))**:
  - For commercial red lasers, the power output is often stable to within \(1\%\) to \(5\%\) of the mean.
  - For a \(5 \, \mathrm{mW}\) laser:
    \[
    \sigma \approx 0.05 \times 5 \, \mathrm{mW} = 0.25 \, \mathrm{mW}.
    \]

---

### **Typical Values for a Commercial Red Laser**
1. **Central Wavelength**:
   - Mean (\(\lambda_{\text{mean}}\)): \(650 \, \mathrm{nm}\).
   - Standard deviation (\(\Delta \lambda\)): \(0.01 \, \mathrm{nm}\) (typical for diode lasers).

2. **Power Output**:
   - Mean (\(\mu\)): \(5 \, \mathrm{mW}\).
   - Standard deviation (\(\sigma\)): \(0.25 \, \mathrm{mW}\).

---

### **Factors Affecting Purity**
1. **Temperature**:
   - Diode lasers are sensitive to temperature, which can broaden their linewidth and affect power stability.
2. **Current Drive**:
   - Fluctuations in current driving the laser can also cause power and frequency variations.
3. **Noise Sources**:
   - Quantum noise and external vibrations contribute to the deviations in power and frequency.

If you're looking for highly precise values for a specific laser, these can be found in the datasheet provided by the manufacturer or measured experimentally with appropriate equipment. Would you like help with modeling this in terms of Gaussian distributions or performing further analysis?
