Short wavelengths carry **more energy** than long wavelengths. Here's why:

---

### **The Energy-Wavelength Relationship**
The energy of a photon (the fundamental unit of light) is given by the equation:

\[
E = h \nu
\]

where:
- \(E\): Energy of the photon.
- \(h\): Planck’s constant (\(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \mathrm{J \cdot s}\)).
- \(\nu\): Frequency of the wave.

The frequency (\(\nu\)) of a wave is related to its wavelength (\(\lambda\)) by the equation:

\[
\nu = \frac{c}{\lambda}
\]

where:
- \(c\): Speed of light (\(3.0 \times 10^8 \, \mathrm{m/s}\)).
- \(\lambda\): Wavelength of the wave.

Substituting this into the energy equation:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

This equation shows that **energy (\(E\)) is inversely proportional to wavelength (\(\lambda\))**:  
- **Shorter wavelength (\(\lambda\)) → Higher energy (\(E\))**.
- **Longer wavelength (\(\lambda\)) → Lower energy (\(E\))**.

### **Why Do Short Wavelengths Carry More Energy?**
1. **Higher Frequency**:
   - Shorter wavelengths mean higher frequencies because \( \nu = \frac{c}{\lambda} \). High frequency corresponds to more oscillations of the wave per second, leading to greater energy.

2. **Direct Proportionality**:
   - Energy depends directly on frequency (\(E = h \nu\)). High-frequency waves (short wavelength) inherently pack more energy per photon.

### **Examples of Energy-Wavelength Differences**
1. **Short Wavelengths**:
   - **Gamma Rays** and **X-rays** have very short wavelengths (\(10^{-12} \, \mathrm{m}\) to \(10^{-8} \, \mathrm{m}\)) and carry extremely high energy. That’s why they can penetrate materials and cause significant ionization.

2. **Long Wavelengths**:
   - **Radio Waves** and **Microwaves** have long wavelengths (\(10^{-1} \, \mathrm{m}\) to \(10^3 \, \mathrm{m}\)) and much lower energy. They are harmless in everyday exposure.

### **Intuition from Real Life**
- A guitar string vibrating very quickly (short wavelength) produces high-pitched, energetic sounds.
- A slow-vibrating string (long wavelength) produces lower-energy, deep sounds.

---

### **Summary**
Short wavelengths carry more energy because energy is inversely proportional to wavelength. High-frequency (short-wavelength) waves oscillate more quickly, packing more energy into each photon. This principle underpins phenomena ranging from the electromagnetic spectrum to quantum physics!
