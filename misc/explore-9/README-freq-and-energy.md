More oscillations per second require more energy because the energy of a wave is directly tied to its frequency (\(\nu\)), which measures how often the wave oscillates per second. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why this is the case:

---

### 1. **Energy and Oscillations in a Wave**
- **Frequency** (\(\nu\)) represents the number of complete oscillations a wave makes per second.
- Each oscillation carries a certain amount of energy, so a higher frequency means more oscillations in the same amount of time, leading to more energy being transmitted.

For electromagnetic waves (e.g., light), this is captured in the equation:

\[
E = h \nu
\]

where \( h \) (Planck's constant) is the proportionality factor linking energy and frequency. **Higher frequency means more energy per photon.**

---

### 2. **Physical Reasoning: Energy in Oscillatory Systems**
Consider how energy is stored and transferred in oscillatory systems, such as springs, pendulums, or waves:
- Oscillations involve the continuous exchange of energy between kinetic and potential forms (e.g., electromagnetic fields in light waves or displacement in mechanical waves).
- Higher frequency means the system must complete this energy transfer more times per second, which requires greater input and expenditure of energy.

---

### 3. **Electromagnetic Waves: Higher Frequency Requires Higher Field Variations**
- In electromagnetic waves, oscillations are changes in the electric and magnetic fields.
- Higher frequency means these fields change direction and amplitude more rapidly.
- Faster changes require more energy to generate and sustain because the system must "work harder" to create these rapid field variations.

---

### 4. **Quantum Explanation: Energy Quanta**
- In quantum mechanics, waves are quantized, meaning they are composed of discrete packets of energy called **photons**.
- Each photon's energy is proportional to the wave's frequency (\(E = h\nu\)).
- Higher frequency waves emit higher-energy photons, meaning it takes more energy to produce each photon, and these photons can interact more energetically with matter.

### 5. **Examples in Real Life**
1. **Visible Light vs. Gamma Rays**:
   - Visible light has a frequency of \(10^{14}\) Hz, while gamma rays can have frequencies over \(10^{20}\) Hz.
   - Gamma rays, with much higher frequencies, carry vastly more energy, which is why they can penetrate matter and cause ionization.

2. **Sound Waves**:
   - High-pitched (high-frequency) sounds require more energy to produce because the vibrations are faster compared to low-pitched sounds.

---

### 6. **Mathematical Intuition**
The power (\(P\)) carried by a wave is proportional to the square of the amplitude (\(A\)) and the square of the frequency (\(\nu\)):

\[
P \propto A^2 \nu^2
\]

Thus, even if the amplitude (intensity) remains constant, doubling the frequency quadruples the energy transmitted by the wave.

---

### Summary
More oscillations per second (higher frequency) require more energy because:
- Each oscillation transfers energy, so more oscillations mean more energy transferred over time.
- Higher frequency involves faster field changes, which demand more energy to generate and sustain.
- In quantum terms, higher frequency corresponds to higher-energy photons. 

This is a fundamental property of waves, whether electromagnetic, mechanical, or quantum.
