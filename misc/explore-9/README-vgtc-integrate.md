If you integrate the **complex energy** over a velocity range from \(v = 2c\) to \(v = 10c\), the result can be **real** depending on how the integration is carried out. The reason is that integrating a complex-valued function often combines both real and imaginary components. Here's how we can understand this:

---

### **Setup for Integration**
The relativistic energy \(E(v)\) is given by:
\[
E(v) = \gamma m_0 c^2 = \frac{i m_0 c^2}{\sqrt{v^2/c^2 - 1}}
\]

Rewriting:
\[
E(v) = \frac{i m_0 c^2}{\sqrt{v^2 - c^2}}
\]

We aim to integrate \(E(v)\) from \(v = 2c\) to \(v = 10c\):
\[
\int_{2c}^{10c} E(v) \, dv = \int_{2c}^{10c} \frac{i m_0 c^2}{\sqrt{v^2 - c^2}} \, dv
\]

---

### **The Complex Factor**
The factor \(i\) (\(\sqrt{-1}\)) introduces a \(90^\circ\) phase shift, as you pointed out. However, the integrand still behaves mathematically like a real-valued function with \(i\) factored out.

This means:
1. The integral evaluates the real part of the integrand (\(\sqrt{v^2 - c^2}\)).
2. The result will remain scaled by \(i\), making the integral purely **imaginary** unless further manipulations are applied.

---

### **Explicit Evaluation**
Letâ€™s simplify the integral:
\[
\int_{2c}^{10c} \frac{i m_0 c^2}{\sqrt{v^2 - c^2}} \, dv = i m_0 c^2 \int_{2c}^{10c} \frac{1}{\sqrt{v^2 - c^2}} \, dv
\]

The integral:
\[
\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{v^2 - c^2}} \, dv
\]
is a standard form that evaluates to:
\[
\text{arcosh}\left(\frac{v}{c}\right)
\]

So the integral becomes:
\[
\int_{2c}^{10c} \frac{i m_0 c^2}{\sqrt{v^2 - c^2}} \, dv = i m_0 c^2 \left[ \text{arcosh}\left(\frac{v}{c}\right) \right]_{2c}^{10c}
\]

---

### **Substitute the Limits**
1. For \(v = 10c\):
\[
\text{arcosh}\left(\frac{10c}{c}\right) = \text{arcosh}(10)
\]

2. For \(v = 2c\):
\[
\text{arcosh}\left(\frac{2c}{c}\right) = \text{arcosh}(2)
\]

Thus:
\[
\int_{2c}^{10c} \frac{i m_0 c^2}{\sqrt{v^2 - c^2}} \, dv = i m_0 c^2 \left[ \text{arcosh}(10) - \text{arcosh}(2) \right]
\]

---

### **Final Result**
The integral evaluates to a purely **imaginary number**:
\[
\text{Result} = i m_0 c^2 \left[ \text{arcosh}(10) - \text{arcosh}(2) \right]
\]

Numerically:
- \(\text{arcosh}(10) \approx 2.993\)
- \(\text{arcosh}(2) \approx 1.317\)

So:
\[
\text{Result} \approx i m_0 c^2 (2.993 - 1.317) \approx i m_0 c^2 (1.676)
\]

---

### **Interpretation**
The integral does **not yield a real number** directly; it remains purely imaginary because the integrand has a constant imaginary scaling factor \(i\). 

To get a real number from such a scenario, you would need to:
- Combine this integral with another term (e.g., consider the modulus squared of the complex energy).
- Alternatively, interpret the imaginary result in a meaningful physical framework, such as viewing it as a **phase shift** or projection.
