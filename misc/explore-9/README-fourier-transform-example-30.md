Here is the updated analysis where the blue light has a 30° phase shift relative to the red light:

1. **Combined Signal (Red + Blue Lasers with Phase Shift)**:
   - The interference pattern is altered due to the 30° phase shift introduced in the blue light.
   - The shifted blue light changes the timing of its peaks relative to the red light, creating a distinct interference pattern.

2. **Fourier Transform Amplitude Spectrum**:
   - The amplitude spectrum still shows the two dominant frequencies corresponding to the red and blue lasers.
   - The phase shift does not alter the magnitude of the frequency components but influences the phase relationships.

3. **Inverse Fourier Transform (Reconstructed Signal)**:
   - The reconstructed signal matches the combined signal, confirming the phase shift is preserved and correctly represented in both the time and frequency domains.

This demonstrates how introducing a phase difference affects the time-domain interference while maintaining the same frequency-domain amplitude representation. Let me know if you'd like a closer look at the phase spectrum or additional details!
