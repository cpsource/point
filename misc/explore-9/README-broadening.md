Temperature broadens the linewidth of a laser due to several physical effects that impact the energy levels of the laser medium and the coherence of emitted light. These effects introduce variations in the laser's emission wavelength or frequency, leading to a broader spectral profile. Here's why:

---

### **1. Doppler Broadening**
- **Mechanism**: At higher temperatures, the atoms or molecules in the laser medium move faster due to increased thermal energy. This motion causes a **Doppler shift** in the frequency of the emitted light:
  \[
  \Delta f \propto v_{\text{thermal}} \propto \sqrt{T}
  \]
  - \(v_{\text{thermal}}\): Thermal velocity of the particles.
  - \(T\): Temperature of the medium.
- **Effect**: The range of velocities leads to a distribution of Doppler shifts, broadening the laser's emission spectrum.

---

### **2. Homogeneous Broadening (Collisional or Pressure Broadening)**
- **Mechanism**: As temperature increases, collisions between atoms, ions, or molecules in the laser medium become more frequent. These collisions perturb the energy levels of the lasing species, causing transient shifts in the frequency of emitted photons.
- **Effect**: This results in a **homogeneous broadening** of the linewidth, as every emitter experiences similar interactions.

---

### **3. Thermal Expansion of the Laser Cavity**
- **Mechanism**: In diode lasers, the semiconductor material expands with temperature, altering the refractive index and physical length of the laser cavity.
- **Effect**: This changes the resonant frequencies of the cavity, causing small fluctuations in the central wavelength and broadening the emission profile.

---

### **4. Refractive Index Changes**
- **Mechanism**: The refractive index of the laser medium or surrounding material changes with temperature. This affects the optical path length of the cavity, altering the effective wavelength of emitted light.
- **Effect**: The temperature-dependent refractive index variation contributes to frequency instability and broadening.

---

### **5. Increased Noise in Semiconductor Lasers**
- **Mechanism**: In diode lasers, temperature affects the carrier density (electrons and holes) in the semiconductor material. Fluctuations in carrier density introduce additional noise into the laser's gain profile.
- **Effect**: This noise manifests as a broadening of the laser's spectral linewidth.

---

### **Overall Broadening**
The total linewidth of the laser, \(\Delta f_{\text{total}}\), is typically a combination of these effects:
\[
\Delta f_{\text{total}} = \sqrt{\Delta f_{\text{Doppler}}^2 + \Delta f_{\text{collisions}}^2 + \Delta f_{\text{thermal}}^2 + \ldots}
\]

- At low temperatures, **collisional broadening** and **refractive index effects** dominate.
- At high temperatures, **Doppler broadening** becomes more significant.

---

### **Practical Example**
For a red diode laser (\(650 \, \mathrm{nm}\)):
- At room temperature (\(T \approx 300 \, \mathrm{K}\)), typical linewidths are in the range of \(0.01 \, \mathrm{nm}\).
- As temperature increases, the linewidth can broaden significantly due to the combined effects described.

---

### **Mitigation**
To minimize temperature-induced broadening:
1. Use **temperature stabilization** (e.g., thermoelectric coolers) to maintain a constant operating temperature.
2. Employ lasers designed with **narrow linewidths**, such as stabilized external-cavity diode lasers (ECDLs).
