When \(v/c\) is used in calculations involving relativistic effects, \(v\) represents the **speed of the object**, and \(c\) is the **speed of light**. The ratio \(v/c\) measures the fraction of the speed of light at which the object is moving. Here's what is typically assumed about \(v\) depending on the context:

### **Assumptions About \(v\) in Relativistic Calculations**
1. **Non-Relativistic Regime (\(v \ll c\)):**
   - If \(v \ll c\), \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}\) approaches \(1\), and relativistic effects are negligible.
   - For everyday scenarios involving photons or low-speed particles (e.g., electrons in a lab), this assumption is valid, and calculations are simpler.

2. **Relativistic Regime (\(v\) close to \(c\)):**
   - If \(v \) is a significant fraction of \(c\) (e.g., \(v/c \geq 0.1\)), relativistic effects become important:
     - Time dilation (\(t' = t/\gamma\)).
     - Length contraction (\(L' = L/\gamma\)).
     - Relativistic energy (\(E = \gamma m_0 c^2\)).

3. **Photon Case (\(v = c\)):**
   - For photons (light), \(v = c\), so \(v/c = 1\). Photons have no rest mass (\(m_0 = 0\)), and their energy is entirely kinetic:
     \[
     E = pc \quad \text{where } p = \frac{h}{\lambda}
     \]

4. **Massive Particles (\(v < c\)):**
   - For particles with rest mass (\(m_0 > 0\)), \(v < c\) always holds. As \(v\) approaches \(c\), \(\gamma\) grows significantly, reflecting the increased relativistic energy:
     \[
     E = \gamma m_0 c^2
     \]

### **In Your Context**
If you're considering **blue light** and **red light**, you're likely assuming \(v = c\), since they are photons. However, if \(v\) is interpreted as the motion of another particle (e.g., a tennis ball or an electron in an external force field), \(v\) would be less than \(c\), and relativistic effects would depend on how close \(v\) is to \(c\).

Let me know if you'd like clarification or specific assumptions tailored to your example!
