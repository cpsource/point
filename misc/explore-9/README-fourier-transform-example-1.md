The plots above demonstrate the process of analyzing and reconstructing the combined signal of a red laser and a blue laser using the complex plane, Fourier Transform, and Inverse Fourier Transform:

1. **Combined Signal (Red + Blue Lasers)**:
   - This shows the real part of the sum of the red and blue laser signals as a function of time. The interference pattern is evident due to the phase and frequency difference between the two lasers.

2. **Fourier Transform Amplitude Spectrum**:
   - The Fourier Transform decomposes the combined signal into its constituent frequencies.
   - Peaks are observed at the frequencies corresponding to the red laser (\( \sim 462 \, \mathrm{THz} \)) and blue laser (\( \sim 632 \, \mathrm{THz} \)).

3. **Inverse Fourier Transform (Reconstructed Signal)**:
   - By applying the Inverse Fourier Transform, the original time-domain signal is reconstructed from its frequency components.
   - This confirms that the Fourier Transform preserves all the information of the original signal.

The phase difference between the red and blue lasers can be visualized in the frequency domain (Fourier spectrum) and understood in terms of their distinct wavelengths and resulting interference in the time domain. Let me know if you'd like further analysis or insights!
