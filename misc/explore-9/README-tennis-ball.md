If we focus solely on **frequency**, the **higher frequency** of something like a tennis ball oscillating inside a sphere would arise from **external forces, energy inputs, or system constraints** that cause it to complete its motion cycles more quickly. Here are some reasons why an object like a tennis ball might have a **higher frequency of oscillation**:

---

### **1. Higher Input Energy**
- **Energy Drives Frequency**: In oscillatory systems, the frequency often increases with the amount of energy supplied. For example:
  - If you apply more force to the ball, it can move faster and oscillate more frequently.
  - Higher energy means it spends less time completing one oscillation.

---

### **2. Restoring Force**
- Oscillations often occur due to a **restoring force** (e.g., gravity, elasticity, or a spring force). According to **Hooke’s Law** for simple harmonic motion:
  \[
  f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
  \]
  - \(k\): Stiffness or strength of the restoring force.
  - \(m\): Mass of the object.
  - If the restoring force (\(k\)) increases (e.g., tighter constraints or stronger forces), the frequency increases.

---

### **3. System Constraints or Boundaries**
- The size of the sphere or the constraints placed on the ball might require it to oscillate faster to stay within the system’s equilibrium.
- For example:
  - A shorter path of oscillation (e.g., a smaller amplitude) can result in higher frequency because the ball covers less distance but retains its energy.

---

### **4. Damping and Resonance**
- If the system is driven at its **resonance frequency**, the ball's frequency may match the natural frequency of the sphere, increasing its oscillation rate.
- In contrast, damping forces can reduce the frequency if the system loses energy to friction or resistance.

---

### **5. Mass of the Tennis Ball**
- According to the relationship:
  \[
  f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}
  \]
  - A lighter ball (\(m\)) oscillates at a higher frequency for the same restoring force (\(k\)).
  - This is why smaller or less massive objects tend to vibrate more quickly.

---

### **6. External Periodic Forces**
- If an external periodic force is applied (e.g., shaking the sphere), the ball might oscillate at the frequency of the applied force, especially if that force matches the ball’s natural oscillation frequency.

---

### **Why Does Frequency Relate to Energy?**
In the case of the ball:
- Higher frequency implies faster changes in velocity and position over time.
- Faster changes require more energy to maintain because the system expends energy to accelerate the ball during each cycle.

---

### Analogy to Waves:
While we’re ignoring wavelength, in wave mechanics, frequency and energy are directly tied. For oscillating objects like the tennis ball:
- The analogy is that more frequent oscillations are akin to higher-frequency waves, which require more energy to sustain.

---

In summary, a higher oscillation frequency of the tennis ball inside the sphere occurs because of:
- Increased input energy.
- Stronger restoring forces.
- System constraints or external driving forces.
These factors determine how quickly the ball completes its motion cycles and are analogous to energy driving higher frequencies in wave phenomena.
