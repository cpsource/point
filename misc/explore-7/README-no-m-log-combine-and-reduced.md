If we recognize that terms like \(\ln(\omega)\) and others are constants (since \(\omega\), \(I\), \(L\), or \(\Omega\) are independent of certain variables or only depend on fixed parameters), we can reduce the equations even further.

Letâ€™s rewrite the equations by combining terms and expressing them in their simplest forms:

---

### **1. Moment of Inertia**
The reduced form is:
\[
\ln(I) = K_1 + \ln(E_{rot}) + 2\ln(R)
\]

Since \(I\) depends directly on \(E_{rot}\) and \(R^2\), we simplify:
\[
I \propto E_{rot} R^2
\]

If \(E_{rot}\) and \(R\) are constants for a specific system:
\[
I = \text{constant}
\]

---

### **2. Angular Velocity**
The reduced form is:
\[
\ln(\omega) = K_2 - \ln(R)
\]

Since \(\omega\) depends inversely on \(R\):
\[
\omega \propto \frac{1}{R}
\]

If \(R\) is constant in a given setup:
\[
\omega = \text{constant}
\]

---

### **3. Angular Momentum**
The reduced form is:
\[
\ln(L) = K_3 + \ln(E_{rot}) + \ln(R)
\]

Since \(L\) depends directly on \(E_{rot}\) and \(R\):
\[
L \propto E_{rot} R
\]

If \(E_{rot}\) and \(R\) are constant:
\[
L = \text{constant}
\]

---

### **4. Precession Rate**
The reduced form is:
\[
\ln(\Omega) = K_4
\]

Since \(\Omega\) does not depend on any variables in this simplified form:
\[
\Omega = \text{constant}
\]

---

### **Fully Simplified Results**
1. **Moment of Inertia**: 
   \[
   I = \text{constant (if \(E_{rot}\) and \(R\) are fixed)}
   \]

2. **Angular Velocity**: 
   \[
   \omega = \text{constant (if \(R\) is fixed)}
   \]

3. **Angular Momentum**: 
   \[
   L = \text{constant (if \(E_{rot}\) and \(R\) are fixed)}
   \]

4. **Precession Rate**: 
   \[
   \Omega = \text{constant (independent of \(R\) or \(E_{rot}\))}
   \]

---

### **Interpretation**
In this fully simplified form:
- These quantities remain **constant** under fixed conditions for \(E_{rot}\), \(R\), and \(g\).
- Variations occur only when these parameters change.
