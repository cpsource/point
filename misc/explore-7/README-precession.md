No, if you spin the gyroscope faster, **the same gravitational force (or torque) will cause less precession, not more**. This is because the precession rate is inversely proportional to the gyroscope's angular momentum (\(L = I \omega\)), which increases with the spin speed. Let’s break this down:

---

### **1. Precession and Angular Momentum**
Precession occurs when a torque (\(\tau\)) is applied to a spinning gyroscope, causing its axis to rotate perpendicular to both the angular momentum (\(L\)) and the applied force. The precession angular velocity (\(\Omega\)) is given by:

\[
\Omega = \frac{\tau}{L}
\]

Where:
- \(\tau = r F_g\): Torque due to gravity.
  - \(r\): Lever arm (distance from pivot to the center of mass).
  - \(F_g = M g\): Gravitational force.
- \(L = I \omega\): Angular momentum.
  - \(I\): Moment of inertia.
  - \(\omega\): Angular velocity (spin speed).

---

### **2. Dependence on Spin Speed (\(\omega\))**
- Increasing the spin speed (\(\omega\)) increases the angular momentum \(L\), since \(L = I \omega\).
- A higher \(L\) reduces the precession angular velocity (\(\Omega\)):
  \[
  \Omega = \frac{\tau}{I \omega}
  \]
- Thus, for the same torque (\(\tau\)), precession becomes slower as the gyroscope spins faster.

---

### **3. Why Does Faster Spinning Reduce Precession?**
1. **Gyroscopic Stability**:
   - A faster-spinning gyroscope has more angular momentum, making it harder for an external torque to change the direction of \(L\).

2. **Energy Distribution**:
   - The torque (\(\tau\)) must "move" the angular momentum vector. With higher \(L\), the effect of a given torque is diluted because the rate of change (\(\frac{dL}{dt}\)) is smaller.

---

### **4. Example Calculation**
#### Case 1: Slow Spin (\(\omega = 10 \, \text{rad/s}\)):
- Let’s assume:
  - \(I = 2 \, \text{kg·m}^2\),
  - \(r = 0.5 \, \text{m}\),
  - \(M = 1 \, \text{kg}\),
  - \(g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2\).
- Torque:
  \[
  \tau = r F_g = 0.5 \cdot 1 \cdot 9.81 = 4.905 \, \text{N·m}
  \]
- Angular momentum:
  \[
  L = I \omega = 2 \cdot 10 = 20 \, \text{kg·m}^2/\text{s}
  \]
- Precession rate:
  \[
  \Omega = \frac{\tau}{L} = \frac{4.905}{20} = 0.245 \, \text{rad/s}
  \]

#### Case 2: Fast Spin (\(\omega = 100 \, \text{rad/s}\)):
- Angular momentum:
  \[
  L = I \omega = 2 \cdot 100 = 200 \, \text{kg·m}^2/\text{s}
  \]
- Precession rate:
  \[
  \Omega = \frac{\tau}{L} = \frac{4.905}{200} = 0.0245 \, \text{rad/s}
  \]

#### Comparison:
- The precession rate decreases tenfold when the spin speed increases by a factor of 10.

### **5. Intuition**
- Think of angular momentum as "rotational inertia for directional changes." The more angular momentum the gyroscope has, the harder it is for a given force to change its orientation, and thus precession slows down.

---

### **6. Summary**
- Faster spinning gyroscopes precess **less** under the same gravitational force.
- Precession angular velocity (\(\Omega\)) is inversely proportional to the gyroscope’s spin speed (\(\omega\)).
- By increasing the spin speed, you increase the gyroscopic stability, making it more resistant to external torques.
