If **moment of inertia (\(I\))** and **rotational energy (\(E_{rot}\))** compensate in such a way that **angular velocity (\(\omega\)) remains constant**, then yes, you could theoretically vary \(I\) and \(E_{rot}\) independently. This would allow \(I\) and \(E_{rot}\) to adjust freely, keeping \(\omega\) stable. However, let's carefully examine the implications and whether you can vary \(\omega\) "all over the place" under these conditions.

---

### **1. The Relationship Between \(E_{rot}\), \(I\), and \(\omega\)**
The fundamental relationship is:
\[
E_{rot} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2
\]

If \(\omega\) is constant:
\[
E_{rot} \propto I
\]

This implies that any change in \(E_{rot}\) must result in a proportional change in \(I\) to maintain constant \(\omega\):
\[
I = K \cdot E_{rot}
\]
Where \(K = \frac{2}{\omega^2}\) is a constant for a fixed \(\omega\).

---

### **2. Allowing \(\omega\) to Vary**
Now, letâ€™s assume you allow \(\omega\) to vary instead of keeping it constant. In this case:
- If you increase \(E_{rot}\) without proportionally increasing \(I\), then \(\omega\) will increase:
  \[
  \omega = \sqrt{\frac{2E_{rot}}{I}}
  \]

- Conversely, if you increase \(I\) while keeping \(E_{rot}\) constant, \(\omega\) will decrease:
  \[
  \omega \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{I}}
  \]

Thus, you can freely vary \(\omega\) by adjusting either \(I\) or \(E_{rot}\), but their relationship remains coupled by the rotational energy equation.

---

### **3. Can You Vary \(\omega\) All Over the Place?**
If you want to vary \(\omega\) arbitrarily:
- You would need **independent control** over \(I\) and \(E_{rot}\), allowing them to compensate for one another.
- However, in a physical system, \(I\) and \(E_{rot}\) are usually constrained by the geometry and energy input, so \(\omega\) cannot vary without limits.

For example:
1. **Increasing \(E_{rot}\) infinitely**:
   - Increases \(\omega\) unless \(I\) also grows.
   - Physical limits like material stress or relativistic effects may restrict this growth.
2. **Decreasing \(I\) toward zero**:
   - Increases \(\omega\) dramatically.
   - Physical constraints (e.g., minimum radius) impose limits.

---

### **4. Realistic Scenarios**
1. **Coupled \(I\) and \(E_{rot}\): Constant \(\omega\)**
   - If \(I \propto E_{rot}\), \(\omega\) remains constant, and you cannot vary \(\omega\) independently.
   - The systemâ€™s stability depends on ensuring \(I\) and \(E_{rot}\) adjust in tandem.

2. **Decoupled \(I\) and \(E_{rot}\): Varying \(\omega\)**
   - If \(I\) and \(E_{rot}\) can be controlled separately, you can vary \(\omega\) freely:
     - Increase \(E_{rot}\) â†’ Increase \(\omega\).
     - Increase \(I\) â†’ Decrease \(\omega\).

---

### **5. Implications for (Point) Theory**
In the context of your **(point)** model:
- **Field Interaction**:
  - Varying \(\omega\) represents how rapidly the (points) interact with the surrounding field.
  - Changes in \(\omega\) could signify shifts in oscillation rates, altering the field distortion and emergent phenomena (e.g., gravity, inertia).

- **Gauge Constraints**:
  - The gauge field may enforce limits on how \(I\), \(E_{rot}\), and \(\omega\) interact. For example:
    - A field might resist rapid changes in \(\omega\) by coupling \(I\) and \(E_{rot}\).
    - Alternatively, it might allow extreme variations if stability is dynamically maintained.

---

### **6. Final Thoughts**
- If \(I\) and \(E_{rot}\) adjust in tandem to keep \(\omega\) constant, you lose the ability to vary \(\omega\).
- If you decouple \(I\) and \(E_{rot}\), you can vary \(\omega\) arbitrarily, but physical constraints (e.g., material limits, field dynamics) will impose bounds.
- In the **(point)** framework, this balance might involve deeper constraints from the gauge field or emergent dynamics, suggesting limits on how \(\omega\) can evolve.
