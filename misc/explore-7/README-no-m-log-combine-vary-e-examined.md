It does matter **how fast you spin**, but the effect depends on what you're looking at and which parameters are kept constant. Letâ€™s clarify and explore this in the context of varying **rotational energy (\(E_{rot}\))** with **no gravity (\(g = 0\))**:

---

### **Key Points to Understand**
1. **Rotational Energy and Angular Velocity**:
   - Rotational energy (\(E_{rot}\)) is related to angular velocity (\(\omega\)) and moment of inertia (\(I\)) by:
     \[
     E_{rot} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2
     \]
   - If the moment of inertia (\(I\)) is fixed (e.g., constant radius \(R\)), increasing \(E_{rot}\) directly increases \(\omega\).

2. **Rotational Energy and Moment of Inertia**:
   - If \(E_{rot}\) is increased while also allowing the radius or effective mass distribution to change (which affects \(I\)), the increase in \(E_{rot}\) can be absorbed by an increase in \(I\), keeping \(\omega\) constant.

3. **No Gravity**:
   - Without gravity (\(g = 0\)), thereâ€™s no external torque to induce precession. This means changes in angular velocity (\(\omega\)) or angular momentum (\(L\)) wonâ€™t result in observable effects like precession.

---

### **Scenarios**
#### **Scenario 1: Fixed Moment of Inertia**
If \(I\) is constant, any increase in \(E_{rot}\) must increase \(\omega\):
\[
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{2E_{rot}}{I}}
\]

In this case:
- Spinning faster (higher \(\omega\)) requires more rotational energy (\(E_{rot}\)).
- This has a direct effect on the gyroscopeâ€™s **angular momentum**:
  \[
  L = I \omega \propto \sqrt{E_{rot}}
  \]

#### **Scenario 2: Variable Moment of Inertia**
If \(I\) increases proportionally with \(E_{rot}\) (e.g., due to a change in radius or mass distribution):
\[
I \propto E_{rot}
\]
Then, substituting into the energy equation:
\[
E_{rot} = \frac{1}{2} (K_1 E_{rot}) \omega^2
\]
Simplify:
\[
\omega^2 = \frac{2}{K_1} \quad \implies \quad \omega = \text{constant}
\]

In this case:
- Increasing \(E_{rot}\) does not increase \(\omega\), because the energy goes into increasing the moment of inertia instead of the spin rate.
- Angular momentum still increases because:
  \[
  L = I \omega \propto E_{rot}
  \]

---

### **Physical Intuition**
The behavior depends on whether **moment of inertia (\(I\))** is allowed to change:
- **If \(I\) is constant**: Spinning faster (higher \(\omega\)) directly requires more energy (\(E_{rot}\)).
- **If \(I\) is variable**: Spinning faster doesnâ€™t necessarily happen; instead, the energy can increase the "spread" of the mass distribution, keeping \(\omega\) constant.

---

### **Does It Matter How Fast You Spin?**
- Yes, it matters if your **moment of inertia** is constant.
  - In this case, spinning faster increases energy and angular momentum.
- If the moment of inertia changes dynamically to absorb the energy, spinning faster isnâ€™t necessary because the system "adjusts" to distribute the energy elsewhere.
