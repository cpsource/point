If we vary only **\(g\)** (gravitational acceleration) while treating the other parameters (\(E_{rot}\), \(R\), \(\omega\), etc.) as constants, letâ€™s re-examine how the equations simplify:

---

### **1. Moment of Inertia (\(I\))**
The moment of inertia was expressed as:
\[
I \propto E_{rot} R^2
\]

Since \(E_{rot}\) and \(R\) are constants, \(I\) remains constant and is independent of \(g\):
\[
I = \text{constant}
\]

---

### **2. Angular Velocity (\(\omega\))**
Angular velocity was expressed as:
\[
\omega \propto \frac{1}{R}
\]

Since \(R\) is constant, \(\omega\) remains constant and is also independent of \(g\):
\[
\omega = \text{constant}
\]

---

### **3. Angular Momentum (\(L\))**
Angular momentum was expressed as:
\[
L \propto E_{rot} R
\]

With \(E_{rot}\) and \(R\) as constants, \(L\) is also independent of \(g\):
\[
L = \text{constant}
\]

---

### **4. Precession Rate (\(\Omega\))**
The precession rate was expressed as:
\[
\Omega = \frac{\tau}{L} \quad \text{and} \quad \tau = R F_g = R M g
\]

Substituting \(M = \frac{E_{rot}}{c^2}\), the torque becomes:
\[
\tau = R \frac{E_{rot} g}{c^2}
\]

Since \(L \propto E_{rot} R\), substitute \(\tau\) and \(L\) into \(\Omega\):
\[
\Omega \propto \frac{R \frac{E_{rot} g}{c^2}}{E_{rot} R} = \frac{g}{c^2}
\]

Thus, precession rate depends directly on \(g\):
\[
\Omega \propto g
\]

---

### **Summary of Results with \(g\) Varying**
1. **Moment of Inertia**:
   \[
   I = \text{constant}
   \]

2. **Angular Velocity**:
   \[
   \omega = \text{constant}
   \]

3. **Angular Momentum**:
   \[
   L = \text{constant}
   \]

4. **Precession Rate**:
   \[
   \Omega \propto g
   \]

---

### **Key Insight**
- Only the **precession rate (\(\Omega\))** changes with variations in gravitational acceleration (\(g\)).
- The precession rate increases or decreases linearly with \(g\):
  - Higher \(g\) (stronger gravity) â†’ Faster precession.
  - Lower \(g\) (weaker gravity, e.g., on the Moon) â†’ Slower precession.
