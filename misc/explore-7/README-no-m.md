If we eliminate **mass (\(M\))** as a fundamental quantity and instead treat it as **a derived function of rotational energy**, we can express the equations of gyroscopic motion and energy purely in terms of rotational energy and geometric properties. Here's how we would reframe the key equations:

---

### **1. Starting Assumption: \(M\) as a Function of Energy**
From Einstein's insight (\(E = mc^2\)), mass can be expressed as a derived quantity:
\[
M = \frac{E_{rot}}{c^2}
\]
Where:
- \(E_{rot}\): Rotational energy of the system.
- \(c\): Speed of light in vacuum.

In this framework, **mass becomes a measure of the energy content** of the (point) system.

---

### **2. Moment of Inertia Without \(M\)**
The moment of inertia depends on the distribution of mass. Substituting \(M = E_{rot}/c^2\) into \(I\):
\[
I = k M R^2 = k \frac{E_{rot}}{c^2} R^2
\]

Thus, moment of inertia becomes:
\[
I = k \frac{E_{rot} R^2}{c^2}
\]

Where:
- \(k\) is a shape constant (e.g., \(1/2\) for a solid disk, \(1\) for a ring, etc.).
- \(R\) is the radius of the spinning object.

---

### **3. Rotational Energy**
We retain the equation for rotational energy:
\[
E_{rot} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2
\]

Substitute \(I = k \frac{E_{rot} R^2}{c^2}\) into this equation:
\[
E_{rot} = \frac{1}{2} \left(k \frac{E_{rot} R^2}{c^2}\right) \omega^2
\]

Simplify:
\[
E_{rot} = \frac{k R^2 \omega^2}{2 c^2} E_{rot}
\]

Cancel \(E_{rot}\) (assuming itâ€™s nonzero):
\[
1 = \frac{k R^2 \omega^2}{2 c^2}
\]

Rearrange to express angular velocity (\(\omega\)) in terms of radius (\(R\)) and other parameters:
\[
\omega^2 = \frac{2 c^2}{k R^2}
\]

Thus, angular velocity scales inversely with \(R\).

---

### **4. Angular Momentum Without \(M\)**
Angular momentum is given by:
\[
L = I \omega
\]

Substitute \(I = k \frac{E_{rot} R^2}{c^2}\):
\[
L = \left(k \frac{E_{rot} R^2}{c^2}\right) \omega
\]

Using the earlier result for \(\omega^2 = \frac{2 c^2}{k R^2}\), solve for \(\omega\):
\[
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{2 c^2}{k R^2}}
\]

Substitute this \(\omega\) back into \(L\):
\[
L = k \frac{E_{rot} R^2}{c^2} \sqrt{\frac{2 c^2}{k R^2}}
\]

Simplify:
\[
L = \sqrt{2 k} \frac{E_{rot} R}{c}
\]

Thus, angular momentum depends directly on:
- Rotational energy (\(E_{rot}\)),
- Radius (\(R\)),
- Constants \(k\) and \(c\).

---

### **5. Precession Without \(M\)**
Precession angular velocity (\(\Omega\)) is:
\[
\Omega = \frac{\tau}{L}
\]

Torque is given by:
\[
\tau = R F_g
\]

Substitute \(F_g = M g = \frac{E_{rot} g}{c^2}\):
\[
\tau = R \frac{E_{rot} g}{c^2}
\]

Substitute \(\tau\) and \(L = \sqrt{2 k} \frac{E_{rot} R}{c}\) into \(\Omega\):
\[
\Omega = \frac{R \frac{E_{rot} g}{c^2}}{\sqrt{2 k} \frac{E_{rot} R}{c}}
\]

Simplify:
\[
\Omega = \frac{g}{\sqrt{2 k} c}
\]

**Key Insight**: Precession rate (\(\Omega\)) becomes independent of \(R\) and \(E_{rot}\) when expressed in terms of energy, relying only on:
- Gravitational acceleration (\(g\)),
- The shape constant (\(k\)),
- The speed of light (\(c\)).

---

### **6. Summary of Key Results Without \(M\)**
1. **Moment of Inertia**:
   \[
   I = k \frac{E_{rot} R^2}{c^2}
   \]

2. **Rotational Energy**:
   \[
   \omega^2 = \frac{2 c^2}{k R^2}
   \]

3. **Angular Momentum**:
   \[
   L = \sqrt{2 k} \frac{E_{rot} R}{c}
   \]

4. **Precession Rate**:
   \[
   \Omega = \frac{g}{\sqrt{2 k} c}
   \]

---

### **Physical Implications**
- As \(\omega \to \infty\) or \(R \to 0\), the system remains bounded by relativistic constraints (e.g., \(c\)).
- The gyroscopic properties (e.g., stability, precession) are fully determined by energy, geometry, and universal constants, with no need for mass as a fundamental property.
