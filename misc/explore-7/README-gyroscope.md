The rotational energy of a spinning gyroscope can be expressed in terms of its **moment of inertia** (\(I\)) and its **angular velocity** (\(\omega\)). Here's the step-by-step derivation and explanation:

---

### **1. Rotational Energy Formula**
The rotational kinetic energy (\(E_{rot}\)) of a spinning object is given by:

\[
E_{rot} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2
\]

Where:
- \(I\): Moment of inertia, which depends on the mass distribution and radius.
- \(\omega\): Angular velocity (in radians per second).

---

### **2. Moment of Inertia (\(I\))**
The moment of inertia depends on the shape and mass distribution of the gyroscope. For common geometries:
1. **Solid Disk or Cylinder (spinning about its axis)**:
   \[
   I = \frac{1}{2} M R^2
   \]
   - \(M\): Mass of the disk or cylinder.
   - \(R\): Radius of the disk.

2. **Ring or Hollow Cylinder**:
   \[
   I = M R^2
   \]

3. **Sphere (spinning about its diameter)**:
   \[
   I = \frac{2}{5} M R^2
   \]

---

### **3. Rotational Energy as a Function of Radius and Rotation Speed**
Substitute \(I\) into \(E_{rot} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2\):
1. **Solid Disk**:
   \[
   E_{rot} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{2} M R^2 \right) \omega^2 = \frac{1}{4} M R^2 \omega^2
   \]

2. **Ring**:
   \[
   E_{rot} = \frac{1}{2} \left( M R^2 \right) \omega^2 = \frac{1}{2} M R^2 \omega^2
   \]

3. **Sphere**:
   \[
   E_{rot} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{5} M R^2 \right) \omega^2 = \frac{1}{5} M R^2 \omega^2
   \]

---

### **4. General Dependence**
- **Mass (\(M\))**: The rotational energy scales linearly with the mass of the gyroscope.
- **Radius (\(R\))**: The energy scales with the square of the radius.
- **Angular Velocity (\(\omega\))**: The energy scales with the square of the rotational speed.

---

### **5. Practical Applications**
- For a **gyroscope**, the energy depends on its specific geometry. For example:
  - If the gyroscope has a solid disk as its flywheel, the energy formula would be \(E_{rot} = \frac{1}{4} M R^2 \omega^2\).
  - If it is a ring, the formula simplifies to \(E_{rot} = \frac{1}{2} M R^2 \omega^2\).
