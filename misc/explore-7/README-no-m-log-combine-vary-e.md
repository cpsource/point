If we set \( g = 0 \) (i.e., no gravitational field) and examine the effects of varying the effective rotational energy (\(E_{rot}\)), hereâ€™s how the equations simplify and change:

---

### **1. Moment of Inertia (\(I\))**
Moment of inertia depends on rotational energy and radius:
\[
I \propto E_{rot} R^2
\]

If \(R\) is constant:
\[
I \propto E_{rot}
\]

So as \(E_{rot}\) varies:
\[
I = K_1 \cdot E_{rot}
\]
Where \(K_1\) is a constant incorporating \(R^2\).

---

### **2. Angular Velocity (\(\omega\))**
Angular velocity depends on the balance between rotational energy and the moment of inertia. From the rotational energy equation:
\[
E_{rot} = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2
\]

Substitute \(I \propto E_{rot}\) into this equation:
\[
E_{rot} = \frac{1}{2} (K_1 \cdot E_{rot}) \omega^2
\]

Simplify:
\[
\omega^2 = \frac{2}{K_1}
\]

Thus, angular velocity becomes constant for a fixed \(R\):
\[
\omega = \sqrt{\frac{2}{K_1}}
\]

\(\omega\) does not depend on \(E_{rot}\) because the increase in energy is entirely absorbed by the increase in moment of inertia.

---

### **3. Angular Momentum (\(L\))**
Angular momentum is related to the moment of inertia and angular velocity:
\[
L = I \omega
\]

Substitute \(I \propto E_{rot}\) and \(\omega = \text{constant}\):
\[
L \propto E_{rot} \cdot \text{constant}
\]

So:
\[
L = K_2 \cdot E_{rot}
\]
Where \(K_2\) incorporates the constant angular velocity and \(R^2\).

---

### **4. Precession Rate (\(\Omega\))**
With \(g = 0\), there is no gravitational torque to induce precession:
\[
\Omega = \frac{\tau}{L} = 0
\]

Precession rate becomes irrelevant in the absence of gravity.

---

### **Summary of Results with \(g = 0\) and Varying \(E_{rot}\)**
1. **Moment of Inertia**:
   \[
   I \propto E_{rot}
   \]

2. **Angular Velocity**:
   \[
   \omega = \text{constant (independent of \(E_{rot}\))}
   \]

3. **Angular Momentum**:
   \[
   L \propto E_{rot}
   \]

4. **Precession Rate**:
   \[
   \Omega = 0
   \]

---

### **Key Insights**
- In the absence of gravity (\(g = 0\)):
  - Increasing \(E_{rot}\) directly increases the moment of inertia (\(I\)) and angular momentum (\(L\)).
  - Angular velocity (\(\omega\)) remains constant because the increased energy is absorbed by the increased inertia, keeping \(\omega\) stable.
