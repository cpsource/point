Cymatics is the study of visible sound and vibrations, and how they create patterns: [1, 2, 3]
Definition
The word "cymatics" comes from the Ancient Greek word k≈∑ma, which means "wave". [1]
How it works
In cymatics experiments, a surface is vibrated, and a thin layer of particles, paste, or liquid is used to make the areas of maximum and minimum displacement visible. [1]
Examples
Some examples of cymatics experiments include: [1, 4]
Using a Chinese spouting bowl, where rubbing the copper handles causes the copper bottom to vibrate [1]
Using a Chladni plate, which is a metal plate with sand on top that's attached to a speaker [1, 4]

Applications
Cymatics has applications in engineering, medicine, and art: [5]
Engineering: Cymatics has helped design and develop instruments and devices that make sound and music. [5]
Medicine: Cymatic therapy uses specific frequencies to help heal the body's natural rhythms. [5]
Art: Cymatics can be used to create art. Some see cymatics as evidence that all things are interconnected. [5]
