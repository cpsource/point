A wave can be described as:

\[
\text{Wave} = f(\text{frequency (}f\text{)}, \text{amplitude (}A\text{)}, \text{wave number (}k\text{)}, \text{phase (}\phi\text{)}, \text{medium properties})
\]

Where:
- **\(f\)**: Frequency (oscillations per second).
- **\(A\)**: Amplitude (maximum displacement).
- **\(k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\)**: Wave number (spatial frequency).
- **\(\phi\)**: Phase (initial position in the oscillation cycle).
- **Medium Properties**: Includes refractive index, elasticity, and density.

These terms fully define the wave's behavior, including its **phase velocity** (\(v_p = \frac{\omega}{k}\)) and **group velocity**.
