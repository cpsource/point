To determine the **intersection coordinates** of two circles, we need their mathematical equations and solve them simultaneously. Here's the process:

---

### **Step 1: Circle Equations**
For two circles:
1. Circle 1: Center \((x_1, y_1)\), radius \(r_1\):
   \[
   (x - x_1)^2 + (y - y_1)^2 = r_1^2
   \]

2. Circle 2: Center \((x_2, y_2)\), radius \(r_2\):
   \[
   (x - x_2)^2 + (y - y_2)^2 = r_2^2
   \]

---

### **Step 2: Solve Simultaneously**
#### Subtract the Equations
By subtracting the two equations, we eliminate the quadratic terms:
\[
(x - x_1)^2 + (y - y_1)^2 - (x - x_2)^2 - (y - y_2)^2 = r_1^2 - r_2^2
\]
Simplify:
\[
2(x_2 - x_1)x + 2(y_2 - y_1)y = r_1^2 - r_2^2 + x_2^2 - x_1^2 + y_2^2 - y_1^2
\]

This gives a linear equation of the form:
\[
Ax + By = C
\]
where:
- \(A = 2(x_2 - x_1)\),
- \(B = 2(y_2 - y_1)\),
- \(C = r_1^2 - r_2^2 + x_2^2 - x_1^2 + y_2^2 - y_1^2\).

#### Solve for \(y\) in Terms of \(x\):
From this equation:
\[
y = \frac{C - Ax}{B}
\]

---

### **Step 3: Substitute into One Circle Equation**
Substitute \(y\) into the equation of Circle 1:
\[
(x - x_1)^2 + \left(\frac{C - Ax}{B} - y_1\right)^2 = r_1^2
\]

Expand and simplify this equation to solve for \(x\). This results in a quadratic equation:
\[
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
\]
where:
- \(a, b, c\) depend on the parameters of the circles (\(x_1, y_1, r_1, x_2, y_2, r_2\)).

Solve this quadratic equation for \(x\) using the quadratic formula:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

#### Compute \(y\):
For each \(x\), calculate \(y\) using:
\[
y = \frac{C - Ax}{B}
\]

---

### **Step 4: Conditions for Intersection**
- The circles intersect if the discriminant (\(b^2 - 4ac\)) of the quadratic equation is **non-negative**.
- If the discriminant is **zero**, the circles touch at exactly one point.

---

### **Example**
Given:
- Circle 1: \((x_1, y_1) = (0, 0)\), \(r_1 = 5\),
- Circle 2: \((x_2, y_2) = (4, 0)\), \(r_2 = 3\).

1. Circle equations:
   \[
   x^2 + y^2 = 25 \quad \text{(Circle 1)}
   \]
   \[
   (x - 4)^2 + y^2 = 9 \quad \text{(Circle 2)}
   \]

2. Subtract equations:
   \[
   2 \cdot 4 \cdot x = 25 - 9 + 16
   \]
   \[
   8x = 32 \quad \implies \quad x = 4
   \]

3. Solve for \(y\):
   Substitute \(x = 4\) into Circle 1:
   \[
   4^2 + y^2 = 25 \quad \implies \quad y^2 = 9 \quad \implies \quad y = \pm 3
   \]

4. Intersection points:
   \[
   (x, y) = (4, 3) \quad \text{and} \quad (4, -3)
   \]

---

### **Summary**
The **intersection points** are found by:
1. Subtracting the circle equations to get a linear equation.
2. Substituting into one circle's equation to solve for \(x\) and \(y\).
3. Verifying the discriminant for intersection conditions.
