To determine under what conditions two circles intersect or touch, we use the **distance between their centers** (\(d\)) and the sum/difference of their radii. Here's the breakdown:

---

### **Conditions for Two Circles to Cross or Touch**

#### 1. **Distance Between Centers**
The distance \(d\) between the centers of the two circles is:
\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]

#### 2. **Intersection or Touch Conditions**
The two circles intersect or touch if:
\[
|r_1 - r_2| \leq d \leq r_1 + r_2
\]
This condition implies:
- \(r_1 + r_2\): The circles touch externally or overlap.
- \(|r_1 - r_2|\): The circles touch internally (one circle is inside the other).

#### 3. **Special Cases**
1. **Touching Externally**:
   - The circles touch externally at exactly one point:
     \[
     d = r_1 + r_2
     \]

2. **Touching Internally**:
   - One circle is inside the other, and they touch at exactly one point:
     \[
     d = |r_1 - r_2|
     \]

3. **Overlapping**:
   - The circles overlap (cross each other's boundaries):
     \[
     |r_1 - r_2| < d < r_1 + r_2
     \]

4. **No Intersection**:
   - The circles are too far apart:
     \[
     d > r_1 + r_2
     \]
   - Or one circle is entirely within the other without touching:
     \[
     d < |r_1 - r_2|
     \]

---

### **Summary of Conditions**
- **Cross or Touch**: \( |r_1 - r_2| \leq d \leq r_1 + r_2 \)
- **Touch Externally**: \( d = r_1 + r_2 \)
- **Touch Internally**: \( d = |r_1 - r_2| \)
- **No Intersection**: \( d > r_1 + r_2 \) or \( d < |r_1 - r_2| \)
