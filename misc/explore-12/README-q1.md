It seems there may be a slight misunderstanding or misspelling in your question, as there is no commonly known "Wernstein radius" in physics or mathematics, and there isn't a notable individual named "Wernstein" associated with such a concept. It’s possible you are referring to:

1. **Einstein Radius**:
   - The Einstein radius is a term used in gravitational lensing. It is the radius at which light from a background object (e.g., a star or galaxy) is bent around a massive foreground object (e.g., a galaxy or black hole) to form a perfect circle, known as an Einstein ring.
   - Formula:
     \[
     \theta_E = \sqrt{\frac{4GM}{c^2} \frac{D_{ls}}{D_l D_s}}
     \]
     where:
     - \( G \): Gravitational constant.
     - \( M \): Mass of the lensing object.
     - \( c \): Speed of light.
     - \( D_l \): Distance from the observer to the lens.
     - \( D_s \): Distance from the observer to the source.
     - \( D_{ls} \): Distance between the lens and the source.

2. **Weinstein**:
   - If you meant Weinstein, there are mathematicians and physicists with this name, such as Alan Weinstein, who is known for work in symplectic geometry and mathematical physics. However, there is no "Weinstein radius" concept attributed to him.

### **Clarification**
If "Wernstein radius" is indeed what you are asking about, it might be a specialized or lesser-known term, or possibly a typo. Could you provide more context or details? For example:
- Is it related to physics, astronomy, or mathematics?
- Was it mentioned in a specific context or article?

Feel free to clarify, and I’ll do my best to help!
