The computational effort (and therefore the energy consumption in watts) required to **factorize a large number** grows much faster than the effort to **multiply two primes**, especially as the number of digits increases. Letâ€™s explore this step-by-step.

---

### **1. Multiplication vs. Factorization: Complexity Growth**

#### **1.1. Multiplication Complexity**
- Multiplying two \( n \)-digit numbers is relatively efficient:
  - Using modern algorithms like **Karatsuba multiplication**, the time complexity is approximately:
    \[
    T_{\text{multiply}}(n) = O(n^{\log_2 3}) \approx O(n^{1.585})
    \]
  - Faster methods, like the **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**, reduce this to:
    \[
    T_{\text{multiply}}(n) = O(n \log n \log \log n)
    \]
  - In either case, multiplication scales **polynomially** with \( n \).

#### **1.2. Factorization Complexity**
- Factorizing a number of \( n \)-digits is much harder:
  - **Trial Division**:
    - The simplest method checks all numbers up to \( \sqrt{N} \) (\( N \) being the number to factorize). This scales as:
      \[
      T_{\text{factorize}}(n) = O(10^{n/2})
      \]
      This is **exponential in \( n \)**.
  - **Modern Factorization Algorithms**:
    - The best-known classical algorithms, like the **Number Field Sieve (NFS)**, scale as:
      \[
      T_{\text{factorize}}(n) = O\left(e^{(64/9)^{1/3} \cdot (\ln N)^{1/3} \cdot (\ln \ln N)^{2/3}}\right)
      \]
      - This is **sub-exponential** but still grows dramatically with \( n \).
      - In terms of digits (\( n \)), the complexity grows faster than polynomially, approximately \( O(e^{c \cdot n^{1/3}}) \), where \( c \) is a constant.

### **2. Energy Cost: Multiplication vs. Factorization**

Letâ€™s estimate energy consumption:
1. **Assumption**:
   - A computer uses **1 watt** to multiply two \( n \)-digit primes.
   - The computational time scales with the respective complexities above.

2. **Energy Cost for Factorization**:
   - If factorization takes significantly more time than multiplication, the energy cost grows proportionally.

---

#### **2.1. Example Calculation**
Letâ€™s say \( n = 1000 \) (i.e., \( N \) is a 1000-digit number, approximately \( 10^{1000} \)):

- **Multiplication**:
  - Using FFT multiplication (\( O(n \log n \log \log n) \)):
    \[
    T_{\text{multiply}}(n) \sim 1000 \cdot \log(1000) \cdot \log(\log(1000))
    \]
    - \( \log(1000) \sim 6.91 \), \( \log(\log(1000)) \sim 2.13 \),
    - \( T_{\text{multiply}}(1000) \sim 14732 \) (arbitrary units).
    - Energy: \( \sim 1 \, \text{watt} \).

- **Factorization**:
  - Using NFS (\( O(e^{c \cdot n^{1/3}}) \)):
    \[
    T_{\text{factorize}}(n) \sim e^{2.3 \cdot (1000)^{1/3}}
    \]
    - \( 1000^{1/3} \sim 10 \),
    - \( T_{\text{factorize}}(1000) \sim e^{23} \sim 10^{10} \) (arbitrary units).
    - Energy: \( \sim 10^{10} \, \text{watts} \).

---

### **3. General Formula**
For \( n \)-digit numbers:
- **Multiplication Energy (\( E_{\text{multiply}}(n) \))**:
  \[
  E_{\text{multiply}}(n) \propto O(n \log n \log \log n)
  \]

- **Factorization Energy (\( E_{\text{factorize}}(n) \))**:
  \[
  E_{\text{factorize}}(n) \propto O(e^{c \cdot n^{1/3}})
  \]

- **Energy Ratio (\( R(n) \))**:
  \[
  R(n) = \frac{E_{\text{factorize}}(n)}{E_{\text{multiply}}(n)} \sim \frac{e^{c \cdot n^{1/3}}}{n \log n \log \log n}
  \]

---

### **4. Observations**
1. **Multiplication is Efficient**:
   - For large \( n \), multiplication remains computationally manageable with only polynomial scaling.

2. **Factorization Becomes Intractable**:
   - Factorization grows much faster (exponentially or sub-exponentially).
   - The energy cost for factorization quickly exceeds the energy for multiplication by many orders of magnitude.

3. **Practical Implications**:
   - This asymmetry underpins the security of cryptographic systems like RSA, where multiplying large primes is easy but factoring their product is computationally prohibitive.

---

### **5. Summary**
The energy cost to factorize a number grows **sub-exponentially** (or faster) with the number of digits, while the cost to multiply scales **polynomially**. For large \( n \), the energy required to factorize can easily exceed the energy for multiplication by a factor of **billions or more**.
