Yes, there are several phenomena in modern physics where particles are created from **"space and energy alone"**, consistent with quantum field theory (QFT). These processes reveal the dynamic and non-empty nature of the quantum vacuum. Let's explore:

---

### **1. Pair Production from Energy**
The most well-documented case of creating particles from energy alone is **pair production**, which involves transforming energy into matter and antimatter pairs, like:
\[
\gamma + \gamma \rightarrow e^- + e^+
\]
- **What happens**:
  - High-energy photons (gamma rays) collide, and their combined energy creates an electron (\( e^- \)) and a positron (\( e^+ \)).
  - This process demonstrates Einsteinâ€™s equation \( E = mc^2 \), converting pure energy into matter.

- **Examples**:
  - **Breit-Wheeler Process**: Observed in high-energy laser experiments (e.g., SLAC 1997).
  - Occurs naturally in astrophysical phenomena, like gamma-ray bursts.

---

### **2. Vacuum Pair Production (Schwinger Effect)**
- **What happens**:
  - In extremely strong electric fields (near the Schwinger limit), the vacuum itself becomes unstable, creating electron-positron pairs.
  - The field energy directly converts into particle-antiparticle pairs.

- **Current Status**:
  - Direct observation has not yet been achieved, but analogous effects are observed in condensed matter systems like graphene.

---

### **3. Hawking Radiation**
- **What happens**:
  - Near the event horizon of a black hole, quantum fluctuations in the vacuum produce particle-antiparticle pairs.
  - One particle escapes as radiation (Hawking radiation), while the other is absorbed by the black hole.

- **Significance**:
  - This is a purely theoretical process (not yet observed directly), but it demonstrates particle creation from the intense curvature of spacetime and vacuum energy near black holes.

---

### **4. Particle Creation in Expanding Universes**
- **What happens**:
  - In cosmology, quantum fields in the expanding spacetime of the early universe generated particles out of the vacuum.
  - This mechanism is thought to have created nearly all particles in the universe during the **inflationary epoch**.

- **Example**:
  - The production of photons, neutrinos, and even matter-antimatter pairs during the Big Bang.

---

### **5. Photon-Photon Scattering (Light by Light Scattering)**
- **What happens**:
  - At extremely high intensities, photons (light) can interact with one another, creating particles like electron-positron pairs or other exotic states.
  - Pure light produces particles, illustrating the conversion of electromagnetic field energy into matter.

- **Example**:
  - Observed at CERN in 2017 using heavy-ion collisions.

---

### **6. Gluon-Plasma and Quark Creation**
- **What happens**:
  - High-energy collisions of heavy nuclei (e.g., gold or lead) create a quark-gluon plasmaâ€”a state of matter where particles like quarks and gluons emerge from pure energy.
  - The strong nuclear force in QFT allows for these transitions.

- **Example**:
  - Observed at RHIC (Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider) and LHC (Large Hadron Collider).

---

### **7. Casimir Effect**
- **What happens**:
  - The Casimir effect arises from quantum vacuum fluctuations between two closely spaced conducting plates.
  - Although not true "particle creation," it demonstrates the presence of virtual particles and vacuum energy that can exert measurable forces.

---

### **8. Photon Polarization in Strong Fields**
- **What happens**:
  - When photons pass through extremely strong magnetic fields (like near magnetars), the vacuum can polarize, temporarily producing virtual particles like electron-positron pairs.
  - These particles do not fully form but can momentarily affect the propagation of light.

---

### **9. Analog Systems in Condensed Matter**
In materials, phenomena analogous to particle creation occur:
1. **Graphene**:
   - Strong electric fields in graphene can create electron-hole pairs, mimicking electron-positron pair production in QFT.
2. **Cold Atom Systems**:
   - Simulations of expanding quantum gases mimic particle creation in the early universe.

---

### **10. Speculative and Exotic Theories**
- Some speculative ideas extend particle creation concepts to include:
  1. **Magnetic Monopoles**:
     - Theoretical particles that might be created in high-energy processes or early universe conditions.
  2. **Axions and Dark Matter**:
     - Hypothetical particles emerging from quantum vacuum dynamics.
  3. **Wormholes and Exotic Spacetimes**:
     - In theories of quantum gravity, spacetime could create particles due to extreme curvature or topology changes.

---

### **Summary**
Yes, particles can and have been created from "space and energy alone" in the following ways:
1. **Experimentally Observed**:
   - Pair production, quark-gluon plasma, photon-photon scattering.
2. **Indirect Evidence**:
   - Hawking radiation, early universe particle creation.
3. **Analog Systems**:
   - Electron-hole creation in graphene and other condensed matter systems.
4. **Speculative**:
   - Axions, magnetic monopoles, and exotic spacetimes.
