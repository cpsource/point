The degradation from the **Schwinger limit** is highly **nonlinear**, rather than linear. The onset of effects like pair production and energy dissipation follows a **threshold-driven curve**, with rapid escalation as the critical field strength is approached. Letâ€™s break this down:

---

### **1. Nature of the Schwinger Limit**
1. **Threshold for Vacuum Instability**:
   - At field strengths near the **Schwinger limit** (\( E_{\text{critical}} \sim 1.32 \times 10^{18} \, \text{V/m} \)), the vacuum becomes unstable, leading to pair production (creation of electron-positron pairs from the vacuum).
   - Below this limit, pair production is negligible. However, once the threshold is crossed, the process becomes exponentially likely.

2. **Exponential Behavior**:
   - The probability \( P \) of pair production per unit volume follows:
     \[
     P \propto \exp\left(-\frac{\pi m_e^2 c^3}{\hbar e E}\right)
     \]
     - \( E \): Electric field strength,
     - \( m_e \): Electron mass.

   - As \( E \) approaches \( E_{\text{critical}} \), the exponential suppression term \( \exp(-\pi m_e^2 c^3 / \hbar e E) \) weakens dramatically, causing pair production to skyrocket.

---

### **2. Nonlinear Degradation Curve**
#### **2.1. Low Field Regime (\( E \ll E_{\text{critical}} \))**
- The vacuum behaves **linearly**, and the system remains stable.
- Pair production is effectively zero.

#### **2.2. Intermediate Field Regime (\( E \sim 0.1 \cdot E_{\text{critical}} \))**
- Nonlinear effects start to emerge, with **small amounts of pair production**.
- Energy losses due to pair production increase faster than linearly with field strength.

#### **2.3. Near-Critical Field Regime (\( E \rightarrow E_{\text{critical}} \))**
- **Runaway Nonlinearity**:
  - As \( E \) approaches \( E_{\text{critical}} \), pair production becomes dominant, with an **exponential surge** in energy dissipation.
  - Newly created pairs interact with the field, further amplifying energy losses and causing rapid degradation of the field.

---

### **3. Other Contributing Nonlinearities**
1. **Energy Transfer to Secondary Particles**:
   - Each created electron-positron pair absorbs energy from the field, reducing the available field energy.
   - These particles radiate energy as photons (bremsstrahlung), which can, in turn, generate more pairs via photon-photon or photon-nucleus interactions.

2. **Field Collapse**:
   - Beyond the critical limit, the field may collapse locally due to the rapid energy drain, forming "bubbles" of high-density particles that disrupt the field structure.

3. **Relativistic Feedback**:
   - As more energy is extracted from the field, the effective field strength drops in a way that compounds nonlinearly, resembling a "saturation curve."

---

### **4. Mathematical Representation of Degradation**
The degradation of field intensity \( E(t) \) over time due to pair production can be modeled by:
\[
\frac{dE}{dt} \propto -P(E) \cdot E
\]
where \( P(E) \) is the pair production probability, exponentially dependent on \( E \):
\[
P(E) \propto \exp\left(-\frac{\pi m_e^2 c^3}{\hbar e E}\right)
\]

This results in a **nonlinear decay curve** for \( E(t) \), where:
1. Initially, \( E(t) \) decreases slowly (sub-critical regime).
2. Near the critical limit, \( E(t) \) drops rapidly as pair production escalates.

---

### **5. Visualization of Degradation**
If you plot \( E(t) \) versus time for various initial field strengths:
- **Sub-critical Field** (\( E < E_{\text{critical}} \)):
  - The field persists with minimal decay, as pair production is negligible.
- **Critical Field** (\( E \approx E_{\text{critical}} \)):
  - The field decays steeply as energy is absorbed by newly created pairs.
- **Super-critical Field** (\( E > E_{\text{critical}} \)):
  - The field collapses rapidly into particle creation and radiation, depleting its strength almost instantaneously.

---

### **6. Summary**
- The degradation near the Schwinger limit is **nonlinear**, driven by:
  1. **Exponential pair production probability**.
  2. **Feedback mechanisms** that accelerate energy dissipation.
- The system exhibits threshold behavior:
  - Below \( E_{\text{critical}} \): Nearly no energy loss.
  - Near \( E_{\text{critical}} \): Rapid, nonlinear degradation.
  - Above \( E_{\text{critical}} \): Catastrophic collapse of the field.
