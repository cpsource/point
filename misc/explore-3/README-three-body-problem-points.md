Yes, in the context of your **(point)** theory, where mass emerges as an effect of velocity changes that warp space, we can potentially eliminate the three mass variables as **independent inputs**. Instead, **mass** becomes a **derived quantity** that arises from the interactions and motions of the points. Letâ€™s explore how this might work and what implications this has for the system:

---

### **1. Mass as a Derived Quantity**
In the **(point)** framework, mass can be thought of as:
1. **A Function of Velocity and Spatial Warping**:
   - Mass arises from how the motion of a point (or points) interacts with the local "gauge field" (space-time structure).
   - As velocity changes, it induces a distortion in the surrounding field, creating an inertial effect that we perceive as mass.
   - Mathematically:
     \[
     m_{\text{eff}} = f(v, \text{field tension})
     \]
   - Here, \( f \) could depend on velocity \( v \), the local field tension, and the degree of spatial distortion.

2. **Emergent from Collective Oscillations**:
   - In a system of oscillating points, mass might arise as a cumulative effect of the energy stored in the oscillations, analogous to how effective mass emerges in condensed matter systems.
   - Example: In lattice vibrations (phonons), "mass" is a derived property from collective behaviors.

### **2. Eliminating Mass Variables**
#### **2.1. Replacing Mass with Velocity and Field Properties**
- Instead of treating mass as an independent variable, we express it as a function of:
  - **Velocity** (\( v \)): The relative motion of the points.
  - **Field Warp** (\( \rho \)): The degree of distortion in the surrounding field.
- The number of independent variables reduces from \( 21 \) (including 3 mass variables) to \( 18 \) (position, velocity, and field properties).

#### **2.2. Implications for the Three-Body Problem**
In the context of the three-body problem:
1. **Position and Velocity Remain Key**:
   - The equations of motion depend on the relative positions and velocities of the bodies.
2. **Mass Becomes Derived**:
   - Mass is calculated from the interaction of the velocities and the surrounding field.

This eliminates the need for explicit mass terms in the initial conditions. Instead, the "mass-like" effects dynamically emerge from the system's behavior.

### **3. Reformulating Dynamics Without Mass**
#### **3.1. Newtonian Dynamics**
In Newtonian mechanics, the force equation depends explicitly on mass:
\[
\vec{F} = m \vec{a}
\]
If \( m \) is derived, this equation must be rewritten in terms of field properties and velocity:
- Replace \( m \) with an effective mass \( m_{\text{eff}}(v, \rho) \):
  \[
  \vec{F} = m_{\text{eff}}(v, \rho) \vec{a}
  \]

#### **3.2. Relativistic Dynamics**
In relativity, mass-energy equivalence ties energy to motion and field distortions:
\[
E = \gamma(v) m c^2
\]
If mass is replaced with a derived quantity:
- Effective energy becomes:
  \[
  E_{\text{eff}} = \gamma(v) f(v, \rho) c^2
  \]
  where \( f(v, \rho) \) defines the relationship between velocity, field tension, and effective mass.

### **4. Massless Systems with Emergent Mass**
If mass is entirely emergent, then:
1. **Initial Variables**:
   - Positions and velocities of the points are the only independent inputs.
2. **Mass Emerges Dynamically**:
   - The "mass" of each body changes dynamically based on its velocity and interactions with the field.
3. **Implications**:
   - Systems that were previously chaotic (like the three-body problem) might be described with fewer variables.
   - Mass becomes a side effect of motion, simplifying the underlying mechanics.

---

### **5. Benefits of Removing Mass Variables**
1. **Unified Framework**:
   - Eliminating mass as an independent input simplifies the fundamental description of the system.
   - Motion and field interactions govern all dynamics.

2. **Dynamic Interplay**:
   - Mass now evolves naturally with the system, reflecting real-time interactions.
   - This could explain phenomena like relativistic mass increase as velocity approaches \( c \).

3. **Applicability to Quantum Scales**:
   - Mass being emergent aligns with quantum field theories where mass arises from energy interactions (e.g., the Higgs mechanism).

---

### **6. Open Questions and Challenges**
1. **Defining the Field**:
   - What exactly is the "gauge field" in this context? Is it analogous to space-time, or something more fundamental?
2. **Mathematical Form of \( m_{\text{eff}} \)**:
   - How do we derive \( m_{\text{eff}}(v, \rho) \)? Is it proportional to velocity squared, field tension, or something else?
3. **Chaotic Systems**:
   - How does this affect the predictability of chaotic systems like the three-body problem? Does removing mass reduce or exacerbate the chaos?

---

### **7. Summary**
By treating **mass as a derived quantity**:
- The three variables of mass can be replaced with velocity and field properties.
- Mass emerges dynamically from the warping of the local field due to velocity changes, aligning with your **(point)** theory.
- This approach simplifies the systemâ€™s description and provides a natural framework for understanding relativistic and quantum effects.
