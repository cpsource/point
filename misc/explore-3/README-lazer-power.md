The power of a laser emitting a single frequency is primarily contained in the **electromagnetic wave** associated with the light it produces. Letâ€™s break this down and explore how this works, conceptually and quantitatively.

---

### **1. The Components of Laser Power**

#### **1.1. Electromagnetic Wave**
A laser emits coherent light, which is an electromagnetic wave with:
- **Electric Field (\(E\))**: Oscillates in one direction.
- **Magnetic Field (\(B\))**: Oscillates perpendicularly to \(E\), forming a transverse wave.
- These fields carry the energy of the laser.

#### **1.2. Energy Density**
The power of the laser is derived from the **energy density** of the electromagnetic field:
- The total energy density \( u \) is:
  \[
  u = \frac{\epsilon_0 E^2}{2} + \frac{B^2}{2\mu_0}
  \]
  where:
  - \( \epsilon_0 \): Permittivity of free space,
  - \( \mu_0 \): Permeability of free space,
  - \( E \): Electric field strength,
  - \( B \): Magnetic field strength.

Since \( B = E/c \), the energy density simplifies to:
\[
u = \epsilon_0 E^2
\]

#### **1.3. Power and Energy Flux**
The power is related to the **Poynting vector (\(S\))**, which measures the energy flux (power per unit area):
\[
S = E \times B / \mu_0
\]
For a single-frequency laser:
\[
S = \frac{E^2}{\mu_0 c}
\]

### **2. Quantized View: Energy in Photons**
For a laser with a single frequency, the power can also be understood in terms of photons:
- **Photon Energy (\(E_\text{photon}\))**:
  \[
  E_\text{photon} = h f
  \]
  where:
  - \( h \): Planck's constant,
  - \( f \): Frequency of the laser.

- **Number of Photons per Second (\(N\))**:
  \[
  N = \frac{P}{E_\text{photon}}
  \]
  where \( P \) is the power of the laser.

This shows that the power is proportional to the number of photons emitted per second.

### **3. Where Is the Power "Stored"?**
#### **3.1. In the Electromagnetic Wave**
- The energy of the laser is carried by the oscillating electric and magnetic fields of the wave.
- These fields propagate through space, transferring energy to objects they interact with (e.g., atoms in a material).

#### **3.2. In the Photons**
- A laser is often described in terms of its photons:
  - Each photon carries a discrete quantum of energy (\(hf\)).
  - The power is distributed among the stream of photons.

### **4. How Does the Laser Generate Power?**
The power originates from the laser's **gain medium**:
1. **Energy Input**:
   - An external energy source (electricity, another light source, etc.) pumps energy into the gain medium.
2. **Stimulated Emission**:
   - Electrons in the gain medium are excited to higher energy states and then release photons when they relax.
   - These emitted photons stimulate other atoms to emit identical photons, amplifying the light coherently.

---

### **5. Summary**
1. **Power is contained in the electromagnetic wave**:
   - Specifically, in the oscillating electric and magnetic fields.
   - The Poynting vector quantifies the energy flux.

2. **Power is also understood in terms of photons**:
   - Each photon carries energy proportional to the laserâ€™s frequency.

3. **Energy transfer is facilitated by the laser's gain medium**:
   - External energy excites atoms, which release photons coherently.
