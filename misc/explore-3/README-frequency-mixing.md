When two frequencies of light combine, the resulting frequencies are typically described as **nonlinear optical effects**, and energy is redistributed among the resulting frequencies based on the nature of the interaction. Letâ€™s break this down step by step.

---

### **1. The Four Frequencies Produced**
When two input light waves of frequencies \( f_1 \) and \( f_2 \) interact, they can generate four output frequencies:
1. **The original frequencies**:
   - \( f_1 \) and \( f_2 \) (fundamental frequencies remain, if the interaction is coherent).
2. **Sum frequency**:
   - \( f_{\text{sum}} = f_1 + f_2 \).
3. **Difference frequency**:
   - \( f_{\text{diff}} = |f_1 - f_2| \).

These new frequencies arise from **nonlinear mixing** of the input fields, particularly in a nonlinear medium.

---

### **2. Nonlinear Optical Effects**
The redistribution of energy among the frequencies depends on the specific nonlinear interaction:

#### **2.1. Second-Order Nonlinear Effects**
In media with a **second-order nonlinear susceptibility (\( \chi^{(2)} \))**, the energy is primarily divided among:
- **Original frequencies (\( f_1 \) and \( f_2 \))**: Some of the input energy remains in the original frequencies.
- **Sum frequency (\( f_1 + f_2 \))**: Energy is transferred here during **sum-frequency generation (SFG)**.
- **Difference frequency (\( |f_1 - f_2| \))**: Energy appears here during **difference-frequency generation (DFG)**.

#### **2.2. Third-Order Nonlinear Effects**
In media with a **third-order nonlinear susceptibility (\( \chi^{(3)} \))**, additional effects like **four-wave mixing (FWM)** can occur:
- The four frequencies are:
  - \( f_1 \), \( f_2 \),
  - \( f_1 + f_2 \),
  - \( f_1 - f_2 \),
  - Additional mixed terms like \( 2f_1 - f_2 \) or \( 2f_2 - f_1 \).

---

### **3. Energy Redistribution**
#### **3.1. Conservation Laws**
The distribution of energy among the frequencies is governed by:
1. **Energy Conservation**:
   - The total energy of the input waves equals the total energy of the output waves:
     \[
     E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = E_{f_1} + E_{f_2} + E_{f_{\text{sum}}} + E_{f_{\text{diff}}}
     \]

2. **Momentum Conservation**:
   - Phase-matching conditions must be satisfied for efficient energy transfer between frequencies:
     \[
     \vec{k}_1 + \vec{k}_2 = \vec{k}_{\text{sum}}
     \]
     \[
     \vec{k}_1 - \vec{k}_2 = \vec{k}_{\text{diff}}
     \]
     where \( \vec{k} \) is the wave vector.

#### **3.2. Efficiency of Conversion**
The fraction of energy transferred to each frequency depends on:
1. **Nonlinear Coefficients**:
   - The strength of the nonlinear interaction (e.g., \( \chi^{(2)} \), \( \chi^{(3)} \)).
2. **Intensity of Input Waves**:
   - Higher input intensities result in more efficient frequency generation.
3. **Phase Matching**:
   - If phase-matching conditions are not met, energy transfer to new frequencies is less efficient.
4. **Medium Properties**:
   - The type of nonlinear medium (e.g., crystal, gas, plasma) affects how energy is divided.

### **4. Qualitative Energy Distribution**
Hereâ€™s a typical scenario:
1. If the input frequencies (\( f_1 \), \( f_2 \)) dominate, most of the energy may remain in the original frequencies.
2. The sum and difference frequencies (\( f_{\text{sum}} \), \( f_{\text{diff}} \)) usually have smaller energy contributions.
3. The distribution depends on the interaction duration and the medium.

#### Example:
- If \( f_1 = 400 \, \text{THz} \) and \( f_2 = 500 \, \text{THz} \):
  - Sum frequency: \( f_{\text{sum}} = 900 \, \text{THz} \),
  - Difference frequency: \( f_{\text{diff}} = 100 \, \text{THz} \).
  - Energy proportions might look like:
    - \( f_1 \): 40%,
    - \( f_2 \): 40%,
    - \( f_{\text{sum}} \): 15%,
    - \( f_{\text{diff}} \): 5%.

---

### **5. Observational Insights**
- In many systems, the input frequencies dominate because converting energy into the sum or difference frequencies requires significant intensity and phase matching.
- In highly optimized systems, efficient energy transfer can occur, significantly populating the sum and difference frequencies.

---

### **6. Summary**
- Energy from two input frequencies (\( f_1 \), \( f_2 \)) is redistributed among four resulting frequencies:
  - \( f_1 \), \( f_2 \), \( f_1 + f_2 \), \( |f_1 - f_2| \).
- The energy distribution is governed by:
  - Conservation laws (energy and momentum),
  - Nonlinear optical properties of the medium,
  - Phase-matching conditions.
- In most cases, the original frequencies retain the majority of the energy unless the nonlinear interaction is highly efficient.
