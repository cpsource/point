The answer depends on **context**â€”whether you're looking at multiplication as a **mathematical operation**, or as a **physical process** within a system governed by entropy. Let's break this down:

---

### **1. Multiplication in Pure Mathematics**
- In **abstract mathematics**, multiplication itself doesnâ€™t inherently increase or decrease entropy because:
  1. **No loss of information in theory**:
     - If you know the product \( c = a \cdot b \) and one factor (e.g., \( a \)), you can uniquely determine the other factor (\( b = c / a \)).
  2. **Reversibility**:
     - Multiplication is reversible through division in mathematical theory.

#### **Entropy-Like Effects in Multiplication**
However, multiplication can mimic entropy in certain ways:
1. **Increased Complexity**:
   - As numbers grow (e.g., \( 10 \cdot 10 = 100 \)), the result can be viewed as more "complex" to describe (e.g., \( 100 \) has more digits than \( 10 \)).
   - Similarly, multiplying matrices or polynomials can increase the degree or size of the resulting expressions.
2. **Loss of Factorization Information**:
   - The product \( c \) doesnâ€™t inherently store its factors (\( a, b \)). Recovering these factors (e.g., factorization of large integers) can be computationally difficult, suggesting an **effective loss of information**.

---

### **2. Multiplication in Physical Systems**
In physical systems, multiplication often represents processes where **entropy increases**, due to energy redistribution, information loss, or irreversibility. Hereâ€™s why:

#### **2.1. Energy Redistribution**
- Multiplication is often used to model interactions (e.g., forces, probabilities, or intensities) that spread energy across systems:
  - Example: Nonlinear interactions in optics (e.g., frequency mixing) multiply input frequencies, creating more complex states with redistributed energy.

- **Entropy Increases**:
  - Energy spread among more degrees of freedom typically increases entropy.

#### **2.2. Loss of Coherence**
- In physical systems, multiplying wavefunctions, probabilities, or amplitudes often results in processes where phase information is "smeared out" or lost.
  - Example: \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), used to calculate probability distributions in quantum mechanics, loses the phase information of \( \psi(x) \), creating a higher-entropy state.

#### **2.3. Multiplication and Nonlinear Systems**
- Multiplicative operations in nonlinear systems often lead to more complex and chaotic behaviors, where the system evolves toward higher entropy states.

---

### **3. Specific Examples of Entropy and Multiplication**

#### **3.1. Mathematical Multiplication**
- Multiplying two integers (\( a, b \)) doesnâ€™t intrinsically increase entropy. However:
  - If you only know the product \( c \), the "hidden" factors \( a, b \) represent lost information.

#### **3.2. Multiplication in Probabilities**
- When calculating joint probabilities (\( P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B) \)), the resulting distribution can be more spread out, reflecting higher entropy in the combined system.

#### **3.3. Multiplication in Waves**
- Combining waves via multiplication (e.g., frequency mixing) spreads energy into new frequencies (e.g., sum and difference), increasing the complexity of the spectrum and the system's entropy.

---

### **4. Multiplication and the Arrow of Time**
The entropy change associated with multiplication in physical systems aligns with the **arrow of time**:
1. Forward Process:
   - Multiplicative processes often increase complexity or spread energy, reflecting entropy growth.
2. Reverse Process:
   - Reversing such processes requires precise control to "unscramble" the original states, which is often infeasible, reinforcing timeâ€™s irreversibility.

---

### **5. Summary**
#### Does entropy increase when you multiply?
1. **In pure math**:
   - No intrinsic entropy change occurs, though effective complexity might grow.
2. **In physical systems**:
   - Multiplication often models processes where entropy increases, such as energy redistribution or loss of coherence.
