The duration for which a photonâ€™s frequency (or wave) is observed after a single electron transition depends on several factors. Letâ€™s break it down:

---

### **1. Key Factors Affecting Duration**
#### **1.1. Natural Lifetime of the Excited State**
- **Quantum Mechanical Transition**:
  - When an electron jumps between energy levels, a photon is emitted.
  - The photon has a frequency \( f = \Delta E / h \), where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the shells.
  - The transition itself is nearly instantaneous (on the order of \( 10^{-15} \) seconds for many systems).

- **Lifetimes of States**:
  - The excited state of the atom or molecule has a characteristic lifetime (\( \tau \)).
  - For many atomic transitions, this lifetime is typically on the order of \( 10^{-9} \) to \( 10^{-8} \) seconds.
  - During this time, the emitted photon can be thought of as forming.

---

#### **1.2. Frequency Uncertainty and the Wave Packet**
- **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**:
  - The energy-time uncertainty relation states:
    \[
    \Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
    \]
    - Here, \( \Delta t \) is the time during which the photon is emitted, and \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy.

  - This implies that the shorter the duration of the emission process, the greater the uncertainty in the frequency (\( \Delta f = \Delta E / h \)).
  - For an electron transition with a well-defined energy gap, the photonâ€™s frequency will have some "spread," related to the finite duration of the emission process.

---

#### **1.3. Waveform Propagation**
- **Wave Packet of the Photon**:
  - The emitted photon is not a single, infinitely long wave but rather a **wave packet**.
  - The temporal extent of this wave packet corresponds to the lifetime of the emission process.

---

### **2. Observed Duration of the Frequency**
The observed duration of the photonâ€™s frequency depends on:
1. **Lifetime of the Emission Process**:
   - A typical photon from an atomic transition will "last" (in terms of its coherence) for a time proportional to the lifetime of the excited state, on the order of \( \tau = 10^{-9} \) seconds.

2. **Detector Sensitivity**:
   - The observer's measurement device may limit the observable duration of the photon. If the photon interacts with the detector, the wave effectively "ends" as it transfers its energy.

---

### **3. Hypothetical Infinite Observation**
If no detector interaction occurs:
- The photonâ€™s wave packet would propagate outward indefinitely.
- However, it would still retain the finite coherence length corresponding to the duration of the emission process.

The **coherence length** is given by:
\[
L_c = c \cdot \tau
\]
where \( c \) is the speed of light. For \( \tau = 10^{-9} \) s, the coherence length is approximately:
\[
L_c \approx 30 \, \text{cm}
\]

---

### **4. Summary**
- The frequency of a photon emitted by an electron jumping one shell one time is **observable during the emission process**, which typically lasts \( 10^{-9} \) to \( 10^{-8} \) seconds.
- After emission, the photon propagates indefinitely as a wave packet, but its coherence (frequency purity) is tied to the emission duration and quantum uncertainty.
