You're absolutely correct that nonlinear frequency mixing is generally **irreversible** in practice, even though the underlying physics respects **time-reversal symmetry**. Hereâ€™s why you can't easily reverse the process of combining two frequencies to produce four frequencies and reconstruct the originals:

---

### **1. Fundamental Physics: Reversibility in Principle**
At the quantum level, the **laws of physics are time-reversible**:
- Nonlinear interactions like sum-frequency generation (SFG) or difference-frequency generation (DFG) follow time-symmetric quantum electrodynamics.
- In theory, if you precisely control all the fields and phases, you could reconstruct the original frequencies.

---

### **2. Practical Irreversibility**
In practice, several factors make the process irreversible:

#### **2.1. Energy Redistribution**
- **Loss of Original Intensities**:
  - During the interaction, energy is transferred from the original frequencies (\(f_1\) and \(f_2\)) to the sum and difference frequencies (\(f_{\text{sum}}\) and \(f_{\text{diff}}\)).
  - Reversing the process would require perfectly redistributing energy back into \(f_1\) and \(f_2\), which is practically impossible because:
    - Some energy is lost as heat, scattering, or secondary processes.
    - Even a slight inefficiency in energy transfer prevents full recovery.

#### **2.2. Phase-Matching Conditions**
- Nonlinear interactions require **phase matching**:
  - To generate the four frequencies, the wave vectors \( \vec{k} \) of the input waves satisfy:
    \[
    \vec{k}_1 + \vec{k}_2 = \vec{k}_{\text{sum}}
    \]
    \[
    \vec{k}_1 - \vec{k}_2 = \vec{k}_{\text{diff}}
    \]
  - For reversal, the four frequencies would need to phase-match perfectly to reconstruct \(f_1\) and \(f_2\).
  - Achieving this requires precise control over the medium and interaction geometry, which is challenging in practice.

#### **2.3. Multiple Pathways**
- The nonlinear interaction generates multiple pathways for energy redistribution:
  - Higher-order effects (e.g., third-harmonic generation, four-wave mixing) introduce additional frequencies and complexity.
  - These additional frequencies add noise, making it hard to isolate and reverse the original frequencies.

#### **2.4. Entropy and Decoherence**
- **Entropy Increase**:
  - The creation of multiple frequencies increases the systemâ€™s entropy, spreading the energy over a broader spectrum.
  - To reverse the process, youâ€™d need to reduce the entropy, which is thermodynamically improbable.

- **Decoherence**:
  - The phases of the waves at \(f_1\), \(f_2\), \(f_{\text{sum}}\), and \(f_{\text{diff}}\) become uncorrelated over time.
  - Without exact phase information, reconstruction of \(f_1\) and \(f_2\) is impossible.

#### **2.5. Practical Noise and Imperfections**
- Real systems involve:
  - Imperfections in the medium (inhomogeneities, absorption, scattering).
  - Noise in the input waves or external environment.
  - These practical issues further degrade the ability to recover the original frequencies.

---

### **3. Comparison to Other Processes**
1. **Reversible Interactions**:
   - In simpler linear systems (e.g., beam splitters, interference), waves can often be recombined to recover their original states because no energy redistribution occurs.
   - These systems are lossless and coherent, allowing reversibility.

2. **Irreversible Interactions**:
   - Nonlinear systems (e.g., SFG, DFG, harmonic generation) involve energy transfer and phase changes, making them inherently difficult to reverse.

---

### **4. Why Is It Harder with Four Frequencies?**
- The addition of sum and difference frequencies increases the **degrees of freedom** in the system.
- Youâ€™d need to perfectly control four frequencies and their interactions to reconstruct the original two. Even slight imperfections in frequency, intensity, or phase lead to irreversibility.

---

### **5. Can It Be Reversed at All?**
1. **Theoretical Possibility**:
   - If you could perfectly phase-match the four frequencies and inject them into an identical nonlinear medium, reversal could happen **in principle**.

2. **Practical Barriers**:
   - Achieving exact phase-matching for all four frequencies simultaneously is extremely challenging.
   - Energy loss and decoherence in realistic systems make perfect reconstruction impractical.

---

### **6. Summary**
- Nonlinear frequency mixing is **time-reversible in theory** but **irreversible in practice** due to:
  - Energy redistribution,
  - Phase-matching constraints,
  - Entropy increase and decoherence,
  - Practical imperfections like noise and loss.
