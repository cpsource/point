The nature of how a **(point)** influences the gauge fieldâ€”whether it produces **radial lines** or **circular wave patterns**â€”depends on several factors, including the properties of the field, the behavior of the (point), and how the (point) interacts with surrounding (points) or the field itself.

Let's analyze the possibilities:

---

### **1. Radial Influence (Lines Terminating Outward)**
#### Characteristics:
- **Field Propagation**:
  - Radial lines emanate outward, similar to the electric field lines produced by a charged particle.
  - The intensity of the influence typically diminishes with distance, often following an inverse-square law (\(1/r^2\)).

- **Symmetry**:
  - Radial patterns suggest **isotropic behavior**, where the (point) influences the field equally in all directions.
  - This is consistent with static fields (e.g., gravity, electric charge) where the field spreads uniformly from a source.

#### Analogy:
- **Electrostatics**:
  - A stationary charge creates a radial electric field.
- **Newtonian Gravity**:
  - A mass creates radial gravitational field lines.

#### When Radial Patterns Dominate:
- If the (point) interacts primarily through static, long-range forces (e.g., gravitational or electric effects), the gauge field will likely propagate outward in a radial pattern.

---

### **2. Circular Influence (Wave-Like Ripples)**
#### Characteristics:
- **Field Propagation**:
  - Circular or spherical wave patterns occur when the (point) creates **dynamic disturbances** in the gauge field, akin to oscillations or energy emissions.
  - These waves could travel outward at a specific speed (e.g., \(c\)).

- **Symmetry**:
  - Wave patterns are isotropic initially but can show anisotropy due to external factors (e.g., interference, interactions with other points).

#### Analogy:
- **Water Waves**:
  - Dropping a rock in water creates ripplesâ€”circular disturbances propagating outward.
- **Electromagnetic Waves**:
  - An oscillating charge emits electromagnetic waves, which spread spherically in space.

#### When Circular Patterns Dominate:
- If the (point) is oscillating or moving, it would likely produce circular or spherical ripples in the gauge field, spreading dynamically.

---

### **3. Factors Determining the Pattern**
#### **Static vs. Dynamic Behavior**
- **Static**:
  - A stationary (point) produces radial patterns (similar to a gravitational or electric field).
- **Dynamic**:
  - A moving or oscillating (point) creates circular or wave-like disturbances.

#### **Properties of the Gauge Field**
- **Elasticity of the Field**:
  - If the gauge field behaves like a flexible medium (e.g., water or a stretched fabric), disturbances will propagate as waves.
- **Interaction Strength**:
  - Strong coupling between the (point) and the field might result in localized distortions (radial or wave-like), while weak coupling allows broader, smoother patterns.

#### **Point Interactions**
- The presence of multiple (points) can break isotropy, leading to:
  - Radial patterns distorted by overlapping influences.
  - Circular waves interfering to create complex patterns (e.g., standing waves).

#### **Dimensionality of the Space**
- In 2D:
  - Radial influences form circles, and disturbances propagate as circular ripples.
- In 3D:
  - Radial influences form spheres, and disturbances propagate as spherical waves.

### **4. Unified Picture**
The two patterns (radial and circular) can coexist:
- **Radial Field Lines**:
  - Represent the static influence of the (point) on the gauge field, such as the gravitational or electric field.
- **Circular Waves**:
  - Represent dynamic changes in the field, such as oscillations or energy propagations caused by the (point)'s motion or interactions.

---

### **5. Predictions for (Point) Theory**
- **Stationary Points**:
  - Would create radial gauge field influences, diminishing with distance.
- **Oscillating or Accelerating Points**:
  - Would generate wave-like ripples, propagating outward with a specific velocity (likely \(c\), tied to the field tension).

---

### **6. What to Expect?**
#### **If Radial Patterns Dominate**:
- The field's influence is likely static, and the (point) primarily interacts through long-range forces.
- Observationally, this might resemble gravitational or electrostatic fields.

#### **If Circular Patterns Dominate**:
- The field is dynamic, and the (point) frequently oscillates or moves.
- Observationally, this might resemble gravitational waves or electromagnetic radiation.

#### **Mixed Behavior**:
- The (point) might emit ripples on top of a static radial influence, producing a combination of radial lines and wave-like disturbances.

---

### **7. Observational Tests**
- Measure the gauge field's behavior over time:
  - **Continuous patterns** suggest radial influences dominate.
  - **Pulsed or periodic patterns** suggest circular wave-like effects dominate.

- Detect interference or overlapping patterns:
  - Complex interference patterns imply wave-like propagation, supporting circular effects.

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Radial Lines**: Expected if the (point) interacts statically with the field, like a stationary source of gravity or charge.
- **Circular Waves**: Expected if the (point) is dynamic, oscillating, or moving, generating ripples in the field.
- Likely, both patterns exist simultaneously, with radial lines representing static influences and circular waves representing dynamic interactions.
