You might be thinking of **Cherenkov Radiation**. Here's why it fits your description:

---

### **What is Cherenkov Radiation?**
Cherenkov radiation is a phenomenon that occurs when a charged particle (like an electron) travels through a medium (e.g., water or glass) at a speed greater than the **phase velocity of light** in that medium. This doesn't violate relativity because the particle isn't exceeding \(c\) in a vacuumâ€”itâ€™s just moving faster than light would in the medium due to the medium's refractive index.

---

### **Key Characteristics**
1. **The Relationship to \(c\)**:
   - The speed of light in a medium is \(v = \frac{c}{n}\), where \(n\) is the refractive index of the medium.
   - If a particle's speed \(v_p > \frac{c}{n}\), Cherenkov radiation is emitted.

2. **Shockwave-Like Emission**:
   - Similar to a sonic boom when an object exceeds the speed of sound, Cherenkov radiation is a "light boom" caused by the particle outrunning the electromagnetic waves it generates in the medium.

3. **Blue Glow**:
   - The radiation often appears as a blue glow due to the wavelength dependence of the radiation (shorter wavelengths are emitted more strongly).

---

### **Why It Might Seem to Violate Something**
1. **Superluminal Speeds in the Medium**:
   - While the particle exceeds the speed of light in the medium, it does not exceed \(c\) in a vacuum, preserving the limits imposed by relativity.

2. **Energy Loss**:
   - The particle emits Cherenkov radiation as it loses energy, which might initially appear to defy energy conservation. However, the radiation accounts for this loss.

---

### **Applications and Observations**
1. **Nuclear Reactors**:
   - Cherenkov radiation is famously seen in the blue glow of underwater nuclear reactors, where high-energy particles travel faster than light in water.

2. **Particle Detectors**:
   - Cherenkov detectors are used in high-energy physics experiments to identify particles moving faster than the local speed of light in a given medium.

3. **Astrophysics**:
   - Cherenkov radiation helps detect cosmic rays and high-energy phenomena in space.

### **Connection to Your Description**
- **Relation to \(c\)**: It involves particles exceeding the local speed of light, tied to \(c\).
- **Seeming Violation**: It might feel like a violation of relativity at first glance.
- **Medium and Oscillations**: The phenomenon arises due to wave propagation and particle-medium interaction, which aligns with your interest in field dynamics.
