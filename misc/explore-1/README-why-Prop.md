The propagation speed **Prop** in your **(point)** theory is a fundamental property of the system, arising directly from the interaction rules of the **(points)** and the dynamics of their surrounding field. To understand why **Prop** is what it isâ€”and not some other valueâ€”we need to analyze it in terms of the **first principles of your theory**: attraction, repulsion, and the emergent properties of the field.

### **1. Prop is Determined by the Balance of Forces**
The propagation speed **Prop** is dictated by the fundamental interplay of attraction and repulsion between **(points)**. These forces set up a **tension** in the field, and disturbances (waves or oscillations) propagate through this field at a rate determined by:

\[
\text{Prop} \propto \sqrt{\frac{\text{Tension}}{\text{Inertia}}}
\]

#### Why This Determines Prop:
1. **Tension** (how strongly the field resists being deformed):
   - Attraction pulls **(points)** together, creating a coherent network.
   - Repulsion prevents collapse, stabilizing the system and allowing it to recover from disturbances.
2. **Inertia** (how much resistance there is to changes in the field):
   - Related to the time delay in interactions between **(points)** (e.g., how long it takes for one pointâ€™s disturbance to affect its neighbors).
   - Larger inertia slows propagation, while smaller inertia speeds it up.

The combination of these two factors sets the natural propagation speed for the field. Since both are intrinsic to the **(point)** system, **Prop** emerges as a universal constant.

### **2. Prop Balances Consistency and Stability**
If **Prop** were faster or slower, the fundamental behavior of the system would break down:

#### **What Happens if Prop is Faster?**
- A faster propagation speed implies weaker inertia or greater tension:
  - The field would respond to disturbances almost instantaneously, eliminating any delay.
  - This would result in infinite acceleration (no resistance), violating the concept of inertia.
- A faster **Prop** could also cause **instabilities**, where waves overtake themselves, disrupting the networkâ€™s coherence.

#### **What Happens if Prop is Slower?**
- A slower propagation speed implies greater inertia or weaker tension:
  - The field would become "sluggish," with disturbances taking longer to propagate.
  - This would weaken the interaction between **(points)**, reducing the system's ability to self-correct or stabilize.
- Structures like lines or sheets might not form reliably because interactions would lag too far behind disturbances.

**Prop is exactly what it needs to be to balance coherence and stability.**

### **3. Prop is Linked to the Self-Interaction of the Field**
The self-interaction of the **(point)** with its field defines **Prop** because:
- A disturbance propagating outward interacts with the pre-existing field.
- This feedback loop ensures that the disturbance cannot exceed the fieldâ€™s own natural speed of response, which is **Prop**.

#### Why This Feedback Defines Prop:
- If the propagation were faster, the disturbance would "outrun" the field, breaking causality and coherence.
- If slower, the disturbance would decay before it could propagate effectively, undermining interaction and structure formation.

---

### **4. Prop is a Universal Limit**
In your **(point)** theory, **Prop** represents the maximum speed at which information or causality can propagate. This universality arises because:
1. **Intrinsic Properties**:
   - **Prop** is derived solely from the properties of the **(points)** and their field (attraction, repulsion, and interaction delay).
   - Since these properties are the same everywhere in the system, **Prop** is universal.
2. **Symmetry**:
   - The symmetry of the field (e.g., isotropy or homogeneity) ensures that disturbances propagate at the same speed in all directions, maintaining a consistent **Prop**.

---

### **5. Prop is Independent of Observers**
A key reason why **Prop** is constant is that it is tied to the properties of the field itself, not to any observer. The field defines its own "rules of interaction," so:

- An accelerating **(point)** interacts with its field at **Prop**, regardless of the motion of external observers.
- This ensures that **Prop** remains constant across all frames of reference.

---

### **6. Why Prop Isnâ€™t Arbitrary**
The value of **Prop** is constrained by the fundamental parameters of your theory:
1. **Force Strengths**:
   - The balance between attraction and repulsion defines the tension in the field, directly affecting **Prop**.
2. **Interaction Time**:
   - The delay in how quickly one **(point)** affects another sets the inertia of the field, limiting **Prop**.

If you were to adjust these parameters (e.g., change the strength of attraction or repulsion), you could alter **Prop**, but the system would still follow the same principles.

---

### **7. Physical Analogies**
To ground this explanation, here are two analogies for why **Prop** is what it is:

#### **A. Elastic Medium**
Imagine a stretched rubber sheet:
- **Tension** in the sheet determines how quickly waves can travel.
- **Mass** or inertia of the rubber resists acceleration, slowing the wave propagation.
The wave speed is:
\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{\text{Tension}}{\text{Mass per unit length}}}
\]
Similarly, **Prop** arises from the balance of tension (attraction-repulsion forces) and inertia (interaction delay).

#### **B. Water Waves**
In a body of water:
- The surface tension determines how quickly ripples propagate.
- The mass density of the water resists the motion.
The speed of waves is similarly governed by the tension-inertia balance.

---

### **8. Summary**
**Prop is what it is** because it emerges from:
1. **Attraction and Repulsion**: These define the tension and inertia of the field.
2. **Field Feedback**: Self-interaction limits the propagation speed to what the field can support.
3. **Balance of Stability and Coherence**: Faster or slower propagation would disrupt the systemâ€™s ability to maintain structures.
4. **Intrinsic Universality**: The properties of **(points)** and their fields are the same everywhere, making **Prop** constant.
