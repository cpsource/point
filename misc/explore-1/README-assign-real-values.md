To work backwards and assign **realistic values** for tension and inertia, we first need to establish a framework. Since tension and inertia govern the **propagation speed** (\( \text{Prop} \)), which in physical terms is often analogous to the speed of light (\( c \)), we will express them in terms of known physical constants or comparable scales for feasibility.

---

### **Key Relationships**
The propagation speed is given by:
\[
\text{Prop} = \sqrt{\frac{\text{Tension}}{\text{Inertia}}}
\]
Rearranging for **Tension**:
\[
\text{Tension} = \text{Prop}^2 \cdot \text{Inertia}
\]

We can assign \( \text{Prop} \approx c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), the speed of light, for a starting point, and then work out plausible values for tension and inertia.

---

### **1. Setting a Baseline for Inertia**
Inertia reflects the **resistance to change in the field** and is comparable to a mass-like property (per unit length or unit area) in a medium. Letâ€™s base it on reasonable assumptions:
- For simplicity, think of **inertia** as analogous to the mass density of a vibrating medium.
- A realistic "mass density" for a quantum-level field might be extremely small, say \( \mu \approx 10^{-20} \, \text{kg/m}^3 \) or smaller.

---

### **2. Calculating Tension**
Using the above formula, with:
- \( \text{Prop} = c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)
- \( \text{Inertia} = 10^{-20} \, \text{kg/m}^3 \)

We calculate:
\[
\text{Tension} = (3 \times 10^8)^2 \cdot 10^{-20}
\]
\[
\text{Tension} = 9 \times 10^{16} \cdot 10^{-20}
\]
\[
\text{Tension} = 9 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{N/m}
\]

---

### **3. Interpreting the Results**
- **Tension**: \( 9 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{N/m} \) is quite small compared to macroscopic systems like rubber bands or steel wires. This reflects the extremely fine-scale forces at work in a field of points.
- **Inertia**: \( 10^{-20} \, \text{kg/m}^3 \) is also very small, consistent with the near-massless nature of quantum fields.

---

### **4. Adjusting for Scale**
If we need to scale these values to other regimes (e.g., to model different propagation speeds), we can adjust either tension or inertia:

#### Example: A Different Propagation Speed
If we set \( \text{Prop} = 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \) (e.g., a much slower field wave speed), we could recalculate:
\[
\text{Tension} = (10^6)^2 \cdot 10^{-20}
\]
\[
\text{Tension} = 10^{-8} \, \text{N/m}
\]
Here, both tension and inertia decrease to match a slower wave propagation.

---

### **5. Relating to Physical Systems**
To ground these values further, consider physical analogies:
- **Tension in Materials**:
  - Steel wire tension is typically much larger, on the order of \( 10^2 \, \text{N/m} \), but our field operates at much smaller scales.
- **Mass Density**:
  - The mass density of air is about \( 1.2 \, \text{kg/m}^3 \), vastly larger than our calculated inertia, reflecting the ethereal nature of the field.

---

### **6. Adjusting Parameters to Match Experimental Scales**
If **(points)** represent physical fields that propagate like electromagnetic waves, we can tune tension and inertia to align with quantum or classical scales.

For example:
- **Inertia of the vacuum** (Casimir force scales):
  - Vacuum energy density is approximately \( 10^{-9} \, \text{J/m}^3 \).
  - This suggests an even lower effective inertia for the field, driving smaller tensions.

---

### **7. Summary of Realistic Values**
For a field propagating at \( \text{Prop} = c \):
- **Inertia**: \( 10^{-20} \, \text{kg/m}^3 \) (adjustable depending on field density assumptions).
- **Tension**: \( 9 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{N/m} \), reflecting weak but consistent forces at quantum scales.
