The gravitational force during nuclear reactions—whether fusion or fission—remains unchanged in its fundamental nature, but there can be slight indirect effects due to changes in the mass and energy distribution of the system.

### **Key Considerations:**
1. **Mass-Energy Equivalence**:
   - According to Einstein’s equation \( E = mc^2 \), the energy released or absorbed during a nuclear reaction corresponds to a very small change in mass.
   - For example:
     - **Fusion**: When two nuclei fuse to form a heavier nucleus, a tiny amount of mass is lost as energy (binding energy) is released. This "lost mass" slightly reduces the total gravitational pull of the system.
     - **Fission**: Similarly, in fission, the mass of the fragments is slightly less than the original nucleus, with the missing mass converted into energy.

   While these mass changes are minuscule compared to the total mass of the system (e.g., a star or a reactor), they technically alter the gravitational field.

2. **Local Gravitational Effects**:
   - During a nuclear reaction, the released energy radiates outward as light, heat, or particles. The redistribution of this energy and mass may create temporary variations in the local gravitational field, but these effects are usually negligible.
   - In extreme astrophysical events, such as supernovae, the massive energy release can significantly alter the local spacetime curvature.

3. **Macroscopic Scale (e.g., in Stars)**:
   - In stars, the balance between gravity and nuclear fusion determines the star’s structure:
     - During active fusion, the energy counteracts gravitational collapse.
     - When fusion ceases (e.g., after iron production), gravity dominates, leading to collapse into white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes.
   - The total gravitational effect changes over time due to large-scale redistribution of mass and energy during these stages.

4. **Astrophysical Singularities**:
   - If a star's mass-energy density exceeds certain limits (e.g., in a neutron star collapsing into a black hole), gravity dominates entirely, warping spacetime to an extreme degree. In these cases, nuclear processes no longer directly influence gravity, as they cease inside the event horizon.

### **Final Answer**:
Gravity itself does not fundamentally change during nuclear reactions, as the force depends on total mass-energy and distance. However:
- **Micro-scale**: A small portion of mass is converted to energy, slightly altering the gravitational field.
- **Macro-scale**: In astrophysical contexts, the redistribution of energy and mass can significantly affect gravitational behavior, especially in events like supernovae or black hole formation.

These effects are governed by the same physical principles but vary in significance depending on the scale of the system.
