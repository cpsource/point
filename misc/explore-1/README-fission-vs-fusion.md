This distinction between energy release from fusion (up to iron) and fission (for heavier elements) lies in the interplay of nuclear forces and the binding energy of atomic nuclei.

### **The Key: Nuclear Binding Energy**
- **Binding energy**: The energy that holds protons and neutrons together in the nucleus. It determines the stability of a nucleus.
- The **binding energy per nucleon** (i.e., per proton or neutron) is highest for elements around **iron (Fe, atomic number 26)** and **nickel (Ni, atomic number 28)**.
- This creates a dividing line in nuclear reactions:
  - **Fusion**: Combines light nuclei to form heavier nuclei. Energy is released as nuclei become more tightly bound, moving closer to the "iron peak."
  - **Fission**: Splits heavy nuclei into lighter nuclei. Energy is released because the fragments move closer to the "iron peak" of stability.

### **Why Fusion Stops at Iron**
- For elements lighter than iron, fusion **increases the binding energy per nucleon**, releasing energy.
- For elements heavier than iron, fusion **decreases the binding energy per nucleon**, requiring energy instead of releasing it.
- Iron is the "energy valley" where the binding energy per nucleon is maximized, so further fusion isn't energetically favorable.

### **Why Fission Starts After Iron**
- For very heavy nuclei (like uranium or plutonium), the binding energy per nucleon decreases because these nuclei become less stable:
  - Large nuclei have more protons, increasing **electrostatic repulsion** between them.
  - The **strong nuclear force**, which binds the nucleus together, has a short range and struggles to counteract this repulsion in large nuclei.
- Splitting these heavy nuclei into smaller, more tightly bound nuclei (closer to the "iron peak") releases energy.

### **Energy Production in Stars and Reactors**
1. **Stars**:
   - Stars generate energy via fusion, burning lighter elements into progressively heavier ones up to iron. Beyond iron, further fusion absorbs energy, so stars cannot fuse heavier elements under normal conditions.
   - In supernovae, the extreme energy from the explosion can force nuclei past the iron barrier, creating elements heavier than iron.

2. **Reactors**:
   - Nuclear reactors exploit fission of heavy elements (like uranium-235 or plutonium-239) because splitting these large nuclei releases substantial energy.

---

### **Summary**
- Fusion works up to iron because energy is released by increasing binding energy per nucleon.
- Fission works after iron because energy is released by breaking apart large, unstable nuclei with lower binding energy per nucleon.  
- Iron and nickel mark the "energy peak," making them the most stable nuclei.
