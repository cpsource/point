The fine-structure constant (\( \alpha \)) is a dimensionless constant characterizing the strength of electromagnetic interaction between elementary charged particles. Its value is known to high precision as:

\[
\alpha \approx 0.0072973525693
\]

Or equivalently:

\[
\alpha \approx \frac{1}{137.035999084} \quad (\text{approximation based on CODATA 2018 values})
\]

This value is accurate to the ten digits listed above, with ongoing improvements in precision based on experimental and theoretical advances.

### **Expanded Precision and Context**
- The value of \( \alpha \) comes from high-precision measurements of phenomena like the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron and quantum electrodynamics (QED) calculations.
- Current precision provides \( \alpha \) to approximately **10 parts per billion (ppb)**. As of CODATA 2018, this represents one of the most precisely determined constants in physics.
