In the **(point)** theory, \(c\) (the speed of light, or the universal speed limit for information or wave propagation) would emerge as a **constant** due to the fundamental properties and interactions of the **(points)** themselves. Here's a breakdown of why this could be the case:

---

### **1. Universal Nature of (Point) Interactions**
- **Interaction Rules**:
  - The speed at which disturbances (waves or oscillations) propagate through the network of **(points)** depends on their **attraction** and **repulsion** forces.
  - These forces are universal and do not depend on an external frame of reference.

#### Why \(c\) is Constant:
- Since all **(points)** are governed by the same interaction rules, the speed at which a wave propagates through the network is determined entirely by the properties of the **(points)** and their connections. This uniformity ensures a constant \(c\).

---

### **2. Dimensional Independence**
- In the **(point)** theory, space and time emerge from the relational dynamics between **(points)**:
  - "Space" is the structure formed by the network of connections between **(points)**.
  - "Time" is the progression of oscillatory or wave-like interactions through the network.

#### Why \(c\) is Constant:
- The emergence of space and time is inherently tied to the network's structure and the interaction rules of the **(points)**.
- As a result, the propagation of any disturbance through this network is independent of the observer's relative motion, making \(c\) a constant.

---

### **3. Local Determinism of Waves**
- **Wave Propagation**:
  - Disturbances in the **(point)** network (e.g., oscillations or displacements) propagate from one **(point)** to its neighbors.
  - The speed of this propagation depends on the local properties of the network:
    - **Strength of attraction/repulsion**.
    - **Distance between adjacent points**.
    - **Interaction delay** (e.g., the time it takes for a disturbance to pass between points).

#### Why \(c\) is Constant:
- If the interaction properties (strength, distance, delay) are uniform throughout the network, the speed of wave propagation is constant everywhere.
- Even if the network is distorted (e.g., due to gravity or relative motion), the local rules ensure that waves still propagate at a constant speed relative to the network itself.

---

### **4. Symmetry of the Point Network**
- **Lorentz Symmetry**:
  - If the **(point)** network has an intrinsic symmetry, such as rotational or Lorentz symmetry, the speed of wave propagation would be invariant under transformations like boosts (relative motion between observers).

#### Why \(c\) is Constant:
- Lorentz symmetry in the network ensures that the propagation speed of disturbances is the same for all observers, regardless of their relative motion.
- This symmetry could emerge naturally from the structure of the **(point)** interactions, just as it does in spacetime in special relativity.

---

### **5. \(c\) as the Maximum Information Speed**
- **Causal Constraints**:
  - In the **(point)** theory, the maximum speed of information transfer is limited by the time it takes for a disturbance to propagate through the network.
  - If the interactions between **(points)** are instantaneous (over infinitesimally small distances) but finite (over larger distances), \(c\) emerges as the limiting speed.

#### Why \(c\) is Constant:
- The maximum speed at which a signal can travel is determined by the properties of the network, not by the observer. This intrinsic limit becomes the universal speed \(c\).

---

### **6. Relativity of Motion in the Network**
- **Relative Motion**:
  - When an observer moves relative to the **(point)** network, the connections between **(points)** might appear distorted (e.g., length contraction, time dilation).
  - However, these distortions do not affect the local speed of wave propagation.

#### Why \(c\) is Constant:
- The relative motion of an observer does not change the local rules of the **(points)**; it only alters the observer's perception of space and time. The waves still propagate through the network at the same intrinsic speed.

---

### **7. Propagation Mechanism**
In the **(point)** theory, disturbances propagate through the network via a consistent mechanism:
- **Oscillation Propagation**:
  - If **(points)** are oscillating entities, a wave propagates by transferring energy or information from one **(point)** to its neighbors.
- **Tension-Based Propagation**:
  - If the network of **(points)** behaves like an elastic medium, the propagation speed is determined by the "tension" (strength of attraction-repulsion) and the "inertia" (time delay of interactions).

The propagation speed \(c\) is then:
\[
c = \sqrt{\frac{\text{tension}}{\text{inertia}}}
\]

#### Why \(c\) is Constant:
- The tension and inertia of the **(point)** network are intrinsic properties, leading to a constant \(c\).

---

### **8. Why \(c\) Is Independent of the Observer**
The constancy of \(c\) arises because:
1. **Local Rules Are Universal**:
   - The interaction rules between **(points)** are the same everywhere in the network.
2. **Emergent Symmetry**:
   - The network's symmetry ensures that waves propagate at the same speed in all directions.
3. **Relational Properties**:
   - Space and time are emergent, defined by the dynamics of the network, so \(c\) is a property of the network itself, not of the observer.

---

### **Conclusion**
In the **(point)** theory, \(c\) emerges as a constant because it is determined by the intrinsic interaction rules of the **(points)**. These rules govern the propagation of disturbances through the network, making \(c\) independent of the observer's frame of reference. This aligns naturally with the principles of relativity, offering a foundation for why \(c\) is universal and constant.
