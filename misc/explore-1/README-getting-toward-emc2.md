You’re absolutely right—we shouldn’t invoke concepts like \( E = mc^2 \) if mass hasn’t been defined. Let’s try to derive an equation for energy from just the two properties you’ve assigned to **(points)**: **attraction** and **repulsion**.

If energy is derived solely from the **interactions** of **(points)**, we need to focus on the **potential and dynamics** arising from these two forces.

---

### **Approach: Energy Derived from Interaction**
Here’s how we might construct an equation for energy step-by-step:

---

### **1. Define a Potential for Attraction and Repulsion**

We need to express the energy associated with how **(points)** interact. A simple model is to use a **potential function** where:

- **Attraction dominates** at long distances.
- **Repulsion dominates** at short distances.
- The system seeks a stable balance between these forces.

#### General Form of Interaction Energy
A common framework is:
\[
U(r) = U_{\text{repulsion}}(r) + U_{\text{attraction}}(r)
\]

Where:
- \( U(r) \) is the potential energy as a function of distance \( r \) between two **(points)**.
- \( U_{\text{repulsion}}(r) \): Short-range repulsive energy.
- \( U_{\text{attraction}}(r) \): Long-range attractive energy.

---

### **2. Mathematical Model for Forces**

#### **Repulsion** (Short-Range):
For repulsion, a steeply rising exponential is a good model:
\[
U_{\text{repulsion}}(r) = \frac{A}{r^n}, \quad n > 1
\]
Where:
- \( A \) is a constant defining the strength of the repulsive interaction.
- \( n > 1 \) ensures the repulsion grows rapidly as \( r \) decreases.

#### **Attraction** (Long-Range):
For attraction, an inverse-square law is a good candidate:
\[
U_{\text{attraction}}(r) = -\frac{B}{r^m}, \quad m \geq 2
\]
Where:
- \( B \) is a constant defining the strength of the attractive interaction.
- \( m \geq 2 \) ensures the attraction diminishes with distance.

---

### **3. Combine the Forces into a Total Potential**

The total potential energy \( U(r) \) is:
\[
U(r) = \frac{A}{r^n} - \frac{B}{r^m}
\]

#### Behavior of \( U(r) \):
1. **At large distances (\( r \to \infty \))**:
   - The repulsion term (\( A/r^n \)) vanishes faster than the attraction term (\( -B/r^m \)).
   - Attraction dominates.

2. **At small distances (\( r \to 0 \))**:
   - The repulsion term (\( A/r^n \)) grows faster than the attraction term.
   - Repulsion dominates, preventing collapse.

3. **At intermediate distances**:
   - A balance occurs where \( U(r) \) has a local minimum.
   - This minimum corresponds to the stable equilibrium distance \( r_{\text{eq}} \), where energy is minimized, and bound structures can form.

---

### **4. Derive the Total Energy**

Energy is the sum of:
1. **Potential Energy (\( U(r) \))**:
   - Arises from the configuration of **(points)**.
2. **Kinetic Energy (\( K \))**:
   - Arises if the **(points)** are moving relative to one another due to attraction or repulsion.

The total energy \( E \) of a system of **(points)** is:
\[
E = K + U(r)
\]

---

### **5. Express Kinetic Energy Dynamically**

Kinetic energy depends on how the points **move**, which is influenced by their potential energy. Using Newtonian intuition:
\[
K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
\]
But since we haven’t defined **mass** (\( m \)) yet, we replace this with a purely relational form, derived from the gradient of the potential:
\[
F = -\frac{dU(r)}{dr}
\]
And:
\[
K \propto \left( \frac{dU(r)}{dr} \right)^2
\]

So the total energy becomes:
\[
E \propto \left( \frac{dU(r)}{dr} \right)^2 + U(r)
\]

---

### **6. Simplify for the Two-Point System**
For two points interacting via \( U(r) = \frac{A}{r^n} - \frac{B}{r^m} \), the total energy of the system is:
\[
E(r) \propto \left( n\frac{A}{r^{n+1}} - m\frac{B}{r^{m+1}} \right)^2 + \frac{A}{r^n} - \frac{B}{r^m}
\]

This expression captures:
- **Potential energy** from attraction and repulsion.
- **Kinetic energy** from motion induced by the forces between points.

---

### **7. What Emerges From This?**
- **Stable Bound Structures**:
  - The balance of attraction and repulsion leads to equilibrium configurations.
  - These configurations could correspond to lines, sheets, or other structures.

- **Derived Energy**:
  - Energy is not intrinsic to a point but emerges from their mutual interactions.
  - The interplay of \( U(r) \) and motion defines the system's total energy.

---

### **Conclusion**
By assigning only **attraction** and **repulsion** to **(points)**, energy naturally emerges as a system property, not an intrinsic one. The equation \( U(r) = \frac{A}{r^n} - \frac{B}{r^m} \) captures the balance of forces, and total energy \( E(r) \) combines potential and motion dynamically. This minimal approach can describe stable structures, motion, and interactions without introducing unnecessary complexity.
