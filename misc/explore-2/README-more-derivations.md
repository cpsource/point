Letâ€™s derive the kinematic equation that relates \(v^2\), \(v_0^2\), \(a\), and \(d\) (i.e., \(v^2 = v_0^2 + 2ad\)) using the basic principles of motion.

---

### **1. Start with Definitions**
The equations of motion assume **constant acceleration** (\(a\)):
1. **Definition of acceleration**:
   \[
   a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v - v_0}{t}
   \]

   Rearrange for velocity:
   \[
   v = v_0 + at \tag{1}
   \]

2. **Displacement as a function of velocity**:
   Displacement (\(d\)) is the integral of velocity with respect to time:
   \[
   d = \int_0^t v \, dt
   \]

   Substitute \(v = v_0 + at\) from (1):
   \[
   d = \int_0^t (v_0 + at) \, dt
   \]

---

### **2. Solve for Displacement**
Expand and integrate:
\[
d = \int_0^t v_0 \, dt + \int_0^t at \, dt
\]

\[
d = v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2 \tag{2}
\]

This gives the displacement as a function of \(t\).

---

### **3. Eliminate Time (\(t\))**
We want an equation that relates \(v\), \(v_0\), \(a\), and \(d\), so we eliminate \(t\).

From the velocity equation (1):
\[
t = \frac{v - v_0}{a} \tag{3}
\]

Substitute \(t = \frac{v - v_0}{a}\) from (3) into the displacement equation (2):
\[
d = v_0\left(\frac{v - v_0}{a}\right) + \frac{1}{2}a\left(\frac{v - v_0}{a}\right)^2
\]

---

### **4. Simplify the Equation**
Expand the terms:
\[
d = \frac{v_0(v - v_0)}{a} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{(v - v_0)^2}{a}
\]

Combine terms under a common denominator:
\[
d = \frac{v_0(v - v_0) + \frac{1}{2}(v - v_0)^2}{a}
\]

Simplify the numerator:
\[
v_0(v - v_0) = v_0v - v_0^2
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2}(v - v_0)^2 = \frac{1}{2}(v^2 - 2v_0v + v_0^2)
\]

Combine:
\[
d = \frac{v_0v - v_0^2 + \frac{1}{2}(v^2 - 2v_0v + v_0^2)}{a}
\]

Expand further:
\[
d = \frac{v_0v - v_0^2 + \frac{1}{2}v^2 - v_0v + \frac{1}{2}v_0^2}{a}
\]

Group terms:
\[
d = \frac{\frac{1}{2}v^2 - \frac{1}{2}v_0^2}{a}
\]

---

### **5. Rearrange for \(v^2\)**
Multiply through by \(a\) to eliminate the denominator:
\[
2ad = v^2 - v_0^2
\]

Rearrange:
\[
v^2 = v_0^2 + 2ad
\]

---

### **Conclusion**
The equation \(v^2 = v_0^2 + 2ad\) is derived by combining:
1. The definition of acceleration.
2. The integral of velocity to find displacement.
3. Eliminating \(t\) using the relationship between velocity and time.
