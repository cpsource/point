Letâ€™s compute the integral:

\[
\int_0^t at \, dt
\]

where \(a\) is constant. The steps are as follows:

---

### **Step 1: Write the Integral**
\[
\int_0^t at \, dt
\]

Here, \(a\) is a constant, so we can factor it out of the integral:

\[
a \int_0^t t \, dt
\]

---

### **Step 2: Find the Antiderivative of \(t\)**
The integral of \(t\) with respect to \(t\) is:
\[
\int t \, dt = \frac{t^2}{2}
\]

---

### **Step 3: Apply the Limits**
Using the limits \(0\) to \(t\):
\[
a \int_0^t t \, dt = a \left[\frac{t^2}{2}\right]_0^t
\]

Substitute the limits:
\[
a \left[\frac{t^2}{2} - \frac{0^2}{2}\right]
\]

Simplify:
\[
a \cdot \frac{t^2}{2}
\]

---

### **Final Answer**
The integral evaluates to:
\[
\int_0^t at \, dt = \frac{1}{2} a t^2
\]
