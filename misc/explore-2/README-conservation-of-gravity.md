The idea of **conservation of gravity** isn't explicitly part of current physics, but the concept can be explored through the principles of **conservation of energy** and **general relativity**. Letâ€™s unpack this idea and see if gravity can be thought of as "conserved" when a black hole forms.

### **1. Gravity and Conservation Principles**
1. **Gravity as a Field, Not a Substance**:
   - Gravity is not a physical "substance" but the result of spacetime curvature caused by energy and mass, as described in Einsteinâ€™s general relativity.
   - Conservation laws typically apply to physical quantities like **energy, momentum, and angular momentum**, not directly to the gravitational field itself.

2. **What Could Conservation of Gravity Mean?**
   - If we reinterpret gravity as an emergent phenomenon tied to energy or mass distributions:
     - Conservation of gravity might mean **preservation of the gravitational influence** of a system, even as mass or energy redistributes (e.g., during a black hole's formation).

### **2. Black Hole Formation and Gravity**
When a black hole forms, gravity **appears conserved** in several ways:
1. **Mass is Conserved (in a Broad Sense)**:
   - During the collapse of a star into a black hole, the total mass-energy of the system is conserved.
   - The black hole's gravitational influence is tied to the total energy, including the original star's mass and any additional energy (e.g., infalling matter or radiation).

2. **Gravitational Field Outside the Event Horizon**:
   - For external observers, the gravitational field far from the black hole doesnâ€™t change after its formation.
   - The starâ€™s mass is now concentrated in the black hole, but the field it produces is identical for distances outside the event horizon.

3. **Loss of Gravitational Radiation**:
   - Some gravitational energy is emitted as **gravitational waves** during the collapse or merger processes.
   - This energy is not lost but radiated outward, contributing to the overall conservation of energy in the system.

### **3. Key Questions About Conservation of Gravity**

#### **3.1. Is the Gravitational "Strength" Conserved?**
- **Yes, externally**: 
  - For an external observer, the gravitational influence (mass-energy of the system) remains the same after a black hole forms.
  - The gravitational strength felt at a distance depends only on the total mass-energy, which is conserved.

- **Inside the Black Hole**:
  - Gravity becomes more intense near the event horizon due to the collapse of mass into a smaller volume.
  - This is a **redistribution** of gravity rather than a creation or loss.

---

#### **3.2. Does Gravity "Disappear" During Gravitational Wave Emission?**
- Gravitational waves carry energy away from the system, slightly reducing the total mass-energy and, therefore, the gravitational influence of the black hole.
- However, this loss is minimal compared to the total mass-energy of the black hole, so the gravitational effect is nearly conserved.

### **4. Exploring Conservation of Gravity in Speculative Physics**

Your **(point)** framework could extend the concept of gravity conservation in novel ways:
1. **Gravity as an Emergent Phenomenon**:
   - If gravity arises from oscillations or interactions of (points) in the gauge field, conservation of gravity could reflect:
     - The total oscillatory energy and gauge field tension remaining constant, even as it redistributes during black hole formation.

2. **Tessellation and Gravitational Influence**:
   - The gravitational field outside the black hole might be conserved because the tessellation of (points) remains stable far from the collapse, even if it destabilizes locally.

3. **Internal Redistribution**:
   - Inside the black hole, the intense oscillations or compression of (points) could represent a "storage" of gravitational potential, maintaining the total influence externally.

---

### **5. Observational Evidence for Conservation**
1. **No Change in Gravitational Influence**:
   - Observations of black hole formation (e.g., through gravitational waves) confirm that the total gravitational pull on distant objects doesnâ€™t change significantly.

2. **Gravitational Wave Signals**:
   - The energy carried away by gravitational waves during events like black hole mergers is consistent with the loss of gravitational energy predicted by conservation laws.

3. **Orbital Dynamics**:
   - Objects orbiting a system where a black hole forms (e.g., binary stars) continue to follow the same gravitational field after the collapse.

---

### **6. Summary**
1. **Conservation of Gravity**:
   - Gravity, as an emergent property of mass-energy and spacetime curvature, is **effectively conserved** in black hole formation:
     - The total mass-energy (source of gravity) remains constant.
     - Gravitational waves account for small energy losses.

2. **Speculative Extensions**:
   - In your **(point)** framework, conservation of gravity could correspond to:
     - Preservation of oscillatory energy or gauge field tension.
     - Redistribution of gravitational effects rather than creation or destruction.
