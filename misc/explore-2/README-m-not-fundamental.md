If \( m \) (mass) is a derived quantity and not an intrinsic property, we must rewrite the math to express mass \( m \) in terms of more fundamental quantities. Let's proceed step by step, treating \( m \) as a result of interactions or properties of a system, rather than as an inherent property.

---

### **1. What Could \( m \) Be Derived From?**
Mass might be related to:
- **Energy (\( E \))**: As in \( m = E / c^2 \), where energy is the fundamental quantity.
- **Field Properties**: Interactions between fundamental points, particles, or fields could give rise to effective mass (e.g., oscillations or tension in a system).
- **Inertia**: Resistance to acceleration could define \( m \), derived from the relationship between force and acceleration.

In our context, let's explore mass as emerging from energy and field dynamics.

---

### **2. Revisiting Relativistic Energy**
The total energy in relativistic mechanics is:
\[
E = \sqrt{(pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2}
\]

If \( m \) is derived, replace it with a function of energy and motion:
\[
m = \frac{E}{c^2}
\]

Substituting this into the energy equation:
\[
E = \sqrt{(pc)^2 + \left(\frac{E}{c^2} c^2\right)^2}
\]

Simplify:
\[
E = \sqrt{(pc)^2 + E^2}
\]

This shows consistency, as the equation simplifies back to itself.

---

### **3. Mass as a Function of Acceleration**
Using Newton's second law (\( F = ma \)), if \( m \) is not fundamental, we can express it as:
\[
m = \frac{F}{a}
\]

Substitute into the work-energy relation:
\[
E = W = F \cdot d
\]

Replace \( F \) with \( ma \):
\[
E = \left(\frac{F}{a}\right) a \cdot d
\]

Simplify:
\[
E = F \cdot d
\]

Here, \( m \) cancels out and no longer appears explicitly, reinforcing that \( m \) is not fundamental but inferred from force and acceleration.

---

### **4. Mass from Field Tension**
If we assume \( m \) emerges from field properties, such as tension (\( \sigma \)) and length scale (\( L \)):
\[
m \propto \sigma \cdot L
\]

For a fundamental displacement (\( d \)):
\[
m = \frac{\sigma \cdot d}{c^2}
\]

Substitute this into the relativistic energy equation:
\[
E = \frac{\sigma \cdot d}{c^2} c^2
\]

Simplify:
\[
E = \sigma \cdot d
\]

This suggests that energy is tied directly to the tension and displacement in the field, with \( m \) being an intermediary.

---

### **5. Mass and Oscillatory Systems**
In oscillatory systems, mass could emerge from the energy of oscillations:
\[
E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]
where:
- \( k \) is the stiffness constant (related to tension),
- \( A \) is the amplitude of oscillation.

Mass could then be derived as:
\[
m = \frac{k}{\omega^2}
\]
where \( \omega \) is the angular frequency of oscillation. Substitute this into energy equations:
\[
E = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{k}{\omega^2} \cdot v^2
\]

Here, \( m \) is a byproduct of oscillatory properties.

---

### **6. Rewriting \( a \cdot d = c^2 \)**
If \( m \) is derived, \( a \cdot d \) should directly link energy and displacement without requiring mass explicitly.

Using \( E = F \cdot d \) and \( F = ma \):
\[
E = \frac{F}{a} \cdot a \cdot d
\]

Simplify:
\[
E = F \cdot d
\]

If \( a \cdot d = c^2 \), then:
\[
F = \frac{E}{c^2}
\]

Mass no longer appears; it is inferred through:
\[
m = \frac{F}{a} = \frac{E}{c^2a}
\]

---

### **7. Conclusion**
Rewriting the math without assuming \( m \) as fundamental leads to:
1. Energy as the primary quantity, with \( m \) derived from energy and motion.
2. \( m \) emerging from field properties, such as tension and displacement.
3. \( a \cdot d = c^2 \) directly linking acceleration, displacement, and relativistic energy without requiring \( m \).
