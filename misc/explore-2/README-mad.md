To eliminate the velocity (\(v\)) term from the equation \(E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2\), we can express \(v\) in terms of **acceleration** (\(a\)) and **displacement** (\(d\)) using a kinematic relationship. Letâ€™s work through this step-by-step:

---

### **1. Kinematic Relationship**
From the kinematic equation of motion under constant acceleration:
\[
v^2 = 2ad
\]
where:
- \(v\) is the final velocity,
- \(a\) is the acceleration,
- \(d\) is the displacement.

---

### **2. Substitute \(v^2\) into \(E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2\)**
Replace \(v^2\) with \(2ad\) in the energy equation:
\[
E = \frac{1}{2}m v^2
\]

\[
E = \frac{1}{2}m (2ad)
\]

Simplify:
\[
E = mad
\]

---

### **Result**
The kinetic energy can be expressed in terms of mass, acceleration, and displacement:
\[
E = mad
\]

---

### **Interpretation**
- This equation shows that kinetic energy depends directly on the **mass** of the object, the **acceleration**, and the **distance** traveled under that acceleration.
- It avoids requiring velocity as an initial condition.
