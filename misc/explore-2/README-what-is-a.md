### **What is Acceleration?**

**Acceleration** is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time. In simpler terms, it describes how quickly an objectâ€™s velocity changes, whether in magnitude (speed) or direction.

Mathematically:
\[
a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}
\]
where:
- \(a\) is acceleration,
- \(\Delta v\) is the change in velocity,
- \(\Delta t\) is the change in time.

Acceleration is a **vector quantity**, meaning it has both magnitude and direction.

### **Units of Acceleration**
In the **SI system**, the units of acceleration are:
\[
\text{meters per second squared (m/s}^2\text{)}
\]

This means:
- For every second that passes, the velocity changes by a certain number of meters per second.

In the **Imperial system**, acceleration is often expressed as:
\[
\text{feet per second squared (ft/s}^2\text{)}.
\]

### **Example**
If a car accelerates from \(0\) to \(20 \, \text{m/s}\) in \(4 \, \text{s}\), the acceleration is:
\[
a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{20 - 0}{4} = 5 \, \text{m/s}^2
\]

### **Types of Acceleration**
1. **Uniform Acceleration**:
   - Velocity changes at a constant rate.
   - Example: Free-fall under gravity (\( g \approx 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)).

2. **Non-uniform Acceleration**:
   - Velocity changes at a variable rate.

3. **Centripetal Acceleration**:
   - Acceleration that changes the direction of velocity, such as in circular motion.
