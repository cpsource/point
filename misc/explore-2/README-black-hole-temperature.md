Black holes are typically **colder** than the stars from which they are formed. Hereâ€™s why, based on current physics and speculative extensions within your **(point)** framework:

---

### **1. Temperature of Stars vs. Black Holes**
1. **Stars**:
   - Stars generate immense heat through nuclear fusion, with temperatures often reaching **millions of Kelvin** in their cores.
   - For example:
     - The Sun's core temperature: ~15 million Kelvin.
     - Massive stars' cores before collapse: ~100 million Kelvin.

2. **Black Holes**:
   - Classical black holes (as predicted by general relativity) have **no intrinsic temperature** in the conventional sense because nothing escapes their event horizon to indicate thermal activity.
   - **Hawking radiation** gives black holes a temperature inversely proportional to their mass:
     \[
     T_{\text{Hawking}} = \frac{\hbar c^3}{8 \pi G M k_B}
     \]
     - For stellar-mass black holes (e.g., 10â€“20 solar masses), this temperature is **incredibly low**: on the order of \( 10^{-8} \) Kelvin, much colder than the cosmic microwave background (~2.7 K).

---

### **2. Why Are Black Holes So Cold?**
1. **Mass vs. Temperature Relationship**:
   - Larger black holes have lower temperatures due to their high mass. The gravitational pull prevents significant Hawking radiation from escaping.
   - Small black holes (hypothetical micro black holes) could be hotter, but stellar-mass and supermassive black holes are extremely cold.

2. **Loss of Nuclear Fusion**:
   - A star's heat comes from nuclear fusion, which ceases during the collapse into a black hole. The remaining gravitational potential energy contributes to the black hole's formation but doesnâ€™t manifest as "heat" due to the event horizon.

3. **Energy Trapped**:
   - Energy inside the black hole is trapped by the event horizon and doesnâ€™t radiate outward in a way that would make the black hole "hot."

---

### **3. Speculative Extensions in the (Point) Framework**
Your **(point)** framework could offer additional perspectives:
1. **Internal Oscillations**:
   - If (points) oscillate inside the black hole, they might reach extremely high localized energies, but this energy is confined and doesnâ€™t escape the event horizon.
   - The oscillatory dynamics could represent **internal "hotspots"**, but these wouldnâ€™t manifest as external temperature.

2. **Hawking Radiation Quantization**:
   - The temperature of Hawking radiation might reflect quantized energy states of oscillating (points). For massive black holes, these states are so low-energy that the temperature remains negligible.

3. **Gauge Field Damping**:
   - As the gauge field stabilizes post-collapse, energy dissipates in gravitational waves (ringdown phase) rather than heat, leaving the black hole cold.

---

### **4. Can Black Holes Ever Be Hotter?**
1. **Hypothetical Micro Black Holes**:
   - Extremely small black holes (with masses far below stellar levels) could have much higher Hawking radiation temperatures.
   - For instance, a black hole with the mass of a mountain could radiate at temperatures comparable to or exceeding the surface of the Sun.

2. **Accretion Disks**:
   - While the black hole itself is cold, the matter in the **accretion disk** around it can become extremely hot due to friction and compression:
     - Temperatures can reach **millions of Kelvin**, emitting X-rays and gamma rays.

---

### **5. Observational Context**
1. **Cold Nature of Black Holes**:
   - Observations of black holes confirm that their Hawking radiation is undetectable for stellar-mass and larger black holes because it is so faint and cold.

2. **Emission from Accretion Disks**:
   - X-ray and gamma-ray emissions often associated with black holes are actually from the **accretion disk**, not the black hole itself.

---

### **6. Summary**
- **Stars** are far hotter than the black holes they form.
- Black holes are **cold**, with Hawking radiation temperatures inversely proportional to their mass.
- Within your **(point)** framework:
  - Internal (point) oscillations could be extremely energetic, but their energy remains confined inside the black hole, maintaining the external perception of coldness.
