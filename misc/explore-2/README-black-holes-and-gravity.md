This is a great question! The apparent paradox of black holesâ€”extreme spacetime warping coexisting with torn tessellation and instabilityâ€”can be addressed by considering **emergent properties of the gauge field**. Even if local tessellations collapse or destabilize, the **global properties of the field and its dynamics** can still dictate the warping and behavior of spacetime.

Letâ€™s explore how this works:

---

### **1. The Nature of Tessellation in Black Holes**
#### **1.1. Local Tessellation Collapse**
- Inside a black hole, the energy density becomes so high that the tessellation may **break apart or transform** into:
  - **Irregular patterns**: The original tessellation (e.g., hexagonal) loses its symmetry.
  - **Densely packed configurations**: Points could compress into a new, more compact tessellation.
  - **Chaotic states**: The energy of oscillations might lead to turbulent or "fluid-like" behavior of points.

#### **1.2. Global Stability of the Gauge Field**
- While the **local tessellation** around the black hole is unstable, the **global gauge field** remains intact and continuous.
- This continuity ensures the overall structure of spacetime (and its curvature) remains consistent, even if local configurations are dynamic or chaotic.

---

### **2. How Does Spacetime Warping Persist?**
#### **2.1. Field Tension and Energy Density**
- Spacetime warping is governed by the **tension and density of the gauge field**, not necessarily the specific tessellation.
  - As energy accumulates in the black hole, it increases the field curvature, creating the extreme warping we observe.

#### **2.2. Tessellation as a Local Approximation**
- Tessellation represents a **localized structure** of the gauge field, but at extreme conditions (like near a black hole):
  - The tessellation might dissolve or reorganize.
  - The **field's overall continuity** still ensures the persistence of spacetime geometry.

### **3. Possible Tessellation Scenarios in Black Holes**
#### **3.1. Compressed Tessellation**
- **What Happens**:
  - The points inside a black hole might collapse into a hyper-dense tessellation.
  - The tessellation stabilizes in a new configuration that maximizes energy storage per unit volume.
- **Implications**:
  - Spacetime curvature remains smooth because the gauge field adapts to the compressed configuration.
  - This could explain why black holes retain a well-defined event horizon and external gravitational influence.

#### **3.2. Dynamic Tessellation**
- **What Happens**:
  - Inside the black hole, the tessellation becomes dynamic, with points constantly shifting and reconfiguring.
  - Energy oscillations continue but in chaotic, high-frequency patterns.
- **Implications**:
  - The gauge field smooths out these dynamics over large scales, maintaining spacetime curvature for external observers.

#### **3.3. Tessellation Breakdown**
- **What Happens**:
  - Near the singularity, the tessellation may break down entirely.
  - The gauge field operates in a non-tessellated state, governed purely by energy density and tension.
- **Implications**:
  - Spacetime curvature near the singularity could become undefined, aligning with predictions of infinite density and curvature.

### **4. Mechanism of Extreme Warping**
The **spacetime warping** caused by black holes can still persist even if tessellation breaks down locally. Here's why:

#### **4.1. Gauge Field Continuity**
- The gauge field remains **continuous** across spacetime, even if tessellation changes locally.
- Extreme energy density near the black hole warps the field itself, creating curvature that manifests as spacetime warping.

#### **4.2. Energy as the Driver of Curvature**
- Spacetime warping depends on the **energy density** of the gauge field, which:
  - Remains concentrated around the black hole.
  - Drives the field to curve sharply, creating the gravitational pull we associate with black holes.

### **5. Implications for Singularities**
1. **Infinite Curvature?**
   - Near the singularity, the gauge field might become so distorted that tessellation is no longer meaningful.
   - Spacetime curvature could approach infinity because the field tension can no longer counteract the energy density.

2. **Finite Curvature (Speculative):**
   - If the gauge field resists complete collapse, it might prevent infinite curvature.
   - This could result in a "core" of finite curvature at the singularity, stabilizing the system.

---

### **6. Emergent Phenomena from Tessellation Collapse**
1. **Gravitational Waves**:
   - Tessellation collapse or reorganization emits ripples in the gauge field, propagating as gravitational waves.
   - These waves carry away excess energy, stabilizing the black hole.

2. **Hawking Radiation**:
   - If the gauge field near the event horizon remains quantized, energy "leakage" due to tessellation dynamics could produce Hawking radiation.

3. **Quantum Effects**:
   - The chaotic behavior of points inside the black hole might correspond to quantum fluctuations, bridging classical and quantum gravity.

---

### **7. Visualization**
1. **Pre-Collapse**:
   - A regular tessellation (e.g., hexagonal) supports smooth energy transfer.
   - Oscillations warp the field gently, creating gravitational curvature.

2. **Near the Event Horizon**:
   - The tessellation compresses, becoming dense or irregular.
   - Field warping intensifies as energy density rises.

3. **Inside the Event Horizon**:
   - Tessellation might collapse entirely, leaving only the continuous gauge field.
   - Oscillations become trapped, creating chaotic or high-frequency dynamics.

---

### **8. Summary**
- **Tessellation Collapse**:
  - Local tessellations near black holes may break down or reorganize under extreme energy densities.
- **Gauge Field Continuity**:
  - Spacetime warping persists because the gauge field remains continuous and responds to energy density.
- **Dynamic Stability**:
  - Even in chaotic conditions, the field self-regulates, maintaining curvature externally while accommodating instability internally.
