Good question! In the equation I provided:

\[
c \propto \sqrt{\frac{\alpha}{\rho}}
\]

I meant that **\( c \) is proportional to** the square root of \( \alpha \) divided by \( \rho \). Specifically, this means:

- If \( \alpha \) (interaction strength) increases, \( c \) increases.
- If \( \rho \) (energy density) increases, \( c \) decreases.

Thereâ€™s no direct multiplication of \( c \) by \( \alpha \) here; instead, \( c \) is influenced by the **ratio** of \( \alpha \) to \( \rho \).

### Why Proportionality Matters
Proportionality (\( \propto \)) means we are not specifying exact constants in the equation but rather focusing on how the quantities scale relative to each other:
- \( c \) scales with \( \sqrt{\alpha} \) (interaction strength).
- \( c \) scales inversely with \( \sqrt{\rho} \) (field density).

If you were asking about an equation where \( c \times \alpha \) appears, that would be different and would require rethinking the relationship. Would you like to revisit the math with that perspective? ðŸ˜Š
