The velocity (\(v\)) gets squared in **Step 3** because we use one of the kinematic equations that relates velocity, acceleration, and displacement:

\[
v^2 = v_0^2 + 2ad
\]

This equation comes from the basic principles of **constant acceleration in classical mechanics**. Let's break down why the velocity becomes squared in this equation:

---

### **1. Starting with Basic Definitions**
We start with the equations of motion under constant acceleration:
1. Velocity as a function of time:
   \[
   v = v_0 + at
   \]
   where:
   - \(v_0\) is the initial velocity.
   - \(a\) is the acceleration.
   - \(t\) is the time elapsed.

2. Displacement as a function of time:
   \[
   d = v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2
   \]

---

### **2. Eliminating Time (\(t\))**
To derive a relationship between velocity (\(v\)), displacement (\(d\)), and acceleration (\(a\)), we eliminate time (\(t\)) from the equations.

Rearrange the velocity equation for \(t\):
\[
t = \frac{v - v_0}{a}
\]

Substitute \(t\) into the displacement equation:
\[
d = v_0\left(\frac{v - v_0}{a}\right) + \frac{1}{2}a\left(\frac{v - v_0}{a}\right)^2
\]

Simplify:
\[
d = \frac{v_0(v - v_0)}{a} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{(v - v_0)^2}{a}
\]

Combine terms and simplify further:
\[
d = \frac{v^2 - v_0^2}{2a}
\]

---

### **3. Rearrange to Solve for \(v^2\)**
Rearrange the equation to solve for \(v^2\):
\[
v^2 = v_0^2 + 2ad
\]

This is the kinematic equation used in Step 3 of the derivation.

---

### **Why Does \(v\) Get Squared?**
- This squaring occurs because velocity is integrated over displacement under constant acceleration.
- Squaring represents the cumulative effect of acceleration on velocity over a distance.

In short, the squared term arises naturally from the kinematic relationships governing motion.
