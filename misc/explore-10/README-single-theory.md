Your critique highlights a significant conceptual limitation in traditional quantum theory and physics at large: the assumption that a **single unified theory** can explain all phenomena at all scales. Instead, you propose a "brick-by-brick" universe, where **different realms (scales or domains) influence larger ones** and operate under their own **unique sets of rules**. This idea challenges the conventional "whole-picture" approach of modern theoretical physics and aligns with the philosophy of **emergent phenomena**. Let’s explore this in detail:

---

### **1. Brick-by-Brick Construction of the Universe**
#### **The Layered Approach**
- In your view, the universe is built incrementally, with:
  - **Smaller realms** (quantum scale) influencing **larger realms** (classical and cosmic scales).
  - Each realm operating under its own **set of principles or rules**, which may not necessarily translate directly to other realms.
  
#### **Emergence of Larger Realms**
- Larger structures emerge from the interaction and aggregation of smaller components, but the **rules governing these larger systems**:
  - Are not necessarily predictable from the smaller components.
  - Might involve entirely new dynamics (e.g., classical mechanics emerges from quantum mechanics but isn’t reducible to it in a straightforward way).

#### **Why a Single Theory Might Fail**
- The quest for a **"Theory of Everything" (TOE)** assumes that a single framework (like string theory or quantum gravity) can explain all phenomena.
- However, the "brick-by-brick" perspective suggests:
  - Each scale introduces new complexity and phenomena.
  - The sum of the parts does not necessarily dictate the whole (and vice versa).

---

### **2. Realms with Different Rules**
#### Examples Across Scales:
1. **Quantum Scale**:
   - Governed by probabilistic behavior, wave-particle duality, and superposition.
   - Interactions occur on timescales and distances where classical intuitions break down.

2. **Classical Scale**:
   - Deterministic and governed by Newtonian mechanics.
   - Emerges from the collective behavior of quantum systems (but is not reducible to quantum mechanics alone).

3. **Cosmic Scale**:
   - Governed by general relativity and large-scale dynamics.
   - Includes emergent structures like galaxies, dark matter halos, and black holes.

#### Independence of Rules:
- **Each realm has its own "language"** and set of rules:
  - Quantum mechanics doesn’t directly govern classical objects but influences them indirectly.
  - Classical systems don’t directly influence cosmic structures except through aggregated mass and energy.

#### Interactions Between Realms:
- Smaller realms influence larger ones through **boundary conditions**, but the larger realms also impose **constraints or feedback loops** that shape the smaller ones.

### **3. The Problem with "Whole-Picture" Theories**
#### Retrospective Over-Simplification:
- Theorists often look at the universe as a "whole" and try to reverse-engineer a single theory to explain everything.
- This approach risks **over-simplifying** the complexity and emergent phenomena of each scale.

#### Loss of Local Rules:
- By focusing on universal laws, we may overlook:
  - **Localized behaviors**: Unique phenomena that occur only within specific scales or contexts.
  - **Scale-specific causality**: The way interactions at one scale govern outcomes in that scale without directly influencing others.

#### Emergence vs Reductionism:
- Modern physics leans heavily on **reductionism** (explaining everything by reducing it to smaller parts).
- Your critique aligns with the philosophy of **emergence**, where larger systems exhibit behaviors that cannot be deduced from their components.

---

### **4. Why This Perspective Matters**
#### (a) **New Paradigms for Physics**
- A "brick-by-brick" model suggests that physics should focus on **local rules at each scale**:
  - Quantum rules for the quantum realm.
  - Different rules for classical and cosmic realms.
  - **Bridges** between realms rather than a single unifying theory.

#### (b) **Practical Limitations of Current Theories**
- Quantum mechanics and general relativity work well within their domains but fail to reconcile:
  - **Quantum gravity** remains elusive because these two frameworks operate under vastly different assumptions.
  - A "brick-by-brick" approach could prioritize bridging these realms instead of forcing a single overarching theory.

#### (c) **Understanding Complex Systems**
- Many real-world systems (e.g., ecosystems, economies) are better understood as emergent, multi-layered phenomena.
- Physics might benefit from adopting similar approaches to describe the universe.

### **5. Possible Framework for a Brick-by-Brick Theory**
#### Step 1: Define Rules for Each Realm
- Identify the **key governing principles** for each scale of the universe:
  - Quantum: Probabilities, wavefunctions, and entanglement.
  - Classical: Deterministic trajectories, forces, and thermodynamics.
  - Cosmic: Spacetime curvature, large-scale flows, and dark energy.

#### Step 2: Study Interactions Between Realms
- Investigate how smaller realms influence larger ones:
  - How do quantum fluctuations shape classical randomness (e.g., Brownian motion)?
  - How do classical systems aggregate to produce cosmic phenomena (e.g., galaxies)?
- Investigate **feedback effects** from larger to smaller realms:
  - How does spacetime curvature influence quantum fields (e.g., Hawking radiation)?
  - How do macroscopic forces (e.g., tides) influence atomic-scale behavior?

#### Step 3: Embrace Emergence
- Accept that larger realms have **emergent properties** that cannot be predicted directly from smaller ones.
- Develop models that treat realms as **hierarchical yet loosely coupled**.

---

### **6. Challenges of a Brick-by-Brick Model**
1. **Complexity**:
   - Each realm requires its own theory, and understanding the interactions between realms introduces additional layers of complexity.
2. **Observability**:
   - Phenomena in smaller realms may not always have measurable effects on larger ones and vice versa.
3. **Theoretical Resistance**:
   - The physics community is heavily invested in the idea of a single unifying theory. A "brick-by-brick" approach would require a paradigm shift.

---

### **7. Examples in Physics Supporting Your Idea**
#### (a) **Effective Field Theories**:
- In quantum field theory, effective field theories describe phenomena at specific scales, ignoring higher-energy effects.
- This aligns with the "brick-by-brick" approach: we use different rules for different realms.

#### (b) **Emergence in Thermodynamics**:
- The second law of thermodynamics emerges from statistical mechanics, even though individual particle collisions are deterministic.

#### (c) **Quantum-to-Classical Transition**:
- The transition from quantum behavior to classical determinism (decoherence) is a real-world example of smaller realms influencing larger ones.

---

### **8. Summary**
Your critique that physicists look for a single theory to explain everything, while ignoring that the universe might be built **brick by brick** with each realm having its own rules, is a compelling challenge to reductionism. A multi-realm approach could better explain the universe's complexity, emphasizing localized rules and emergent phenomena. This perspective encourages bridging scales instead of forcing a single unifying framework.

Would you like to explore how this applies to specific phenomena, such as dark matter, quantum gravity, or cosmological models?
