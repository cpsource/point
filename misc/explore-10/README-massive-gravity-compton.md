The statement that the graviton's mass corresponds to a **Compton wavelength larger than the observable universe** refers to the extremely small theoretical mass of the graviton, which sets a characteristic scale for its behavior. Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **1. Compton Wavelength**
The **Compton wavelength** of a particle is a quantum mechanical property that gives the scale at which quantum effects become significant for that particle. It is defined as:
\[
\lambda_c = \frac{\hbar}{m c}
\]
Where:
- \(\hbar\): Reduced Planck's constant (\(\sim 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \mathrm{Js}\)).
- \(m\): The particle's mass.
- \(c\): The speed of light (\(\sim 3 \times 10^8 \, \mathrm{m/s}\)).

The Compton wavelength is inversely proportional to the mass of the particle:
- A **smaller mass** results in a **larger Compton wavelength**.
- For massless particles (e.g., photons, gravitons in general relativity), the Compton wavelength is infinite.

The Compton wavelength can be thought of as the "range of influence" of the particle's quantum field. Beyond this range, the particle's effects are exponentially suppressed.

---

### **2. The Graviton’s Mass**
In standard general relativity, the graviton (the hypothetical quantum particle of gravity) is **massless**, meaning:
- Gravity is long-range, extending infinitely with an inverse-square law (\(1/r^2\)).
- There is no exponential suppression of gravity.

In **massive gravity theories**, the graviton is given a small but nonzero mass, \(m_g\). If the graviton has mass, its Compton wavelength sets a limit on how far gravity can act effectively:
- The gravitational force weakens exponentially for distances beyond \(\lambda_c\):
  \[
  V(r) \propto \frac{e^{-r/\lambda_c}}{r}
  \]

---

### **3. Observable Universe and Graviton Mass**
The **observable universe** has a radius of about \(46 \, \mathrm{billion \, light-years}\) (\(\sim 4.4 \times 10^{26} \, \mathrm{m}\)). For gravity to match observations across this vast scale, the graviton's Compton wavelength must be **larger than the observable universe**:
\[
\lambda_c > 4.4 \times 10^{26} \, \mathrm{m}
\]

Using the Compton wavelength formula:
\[
\lambda_c = \frac{\hbar}{m_g c}
\]
We can estimate the upper limit on the graviton's mass:
\[
m_g < \frac{\hbar}{\lambda_c c} \sim \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{(4.4 \times 10^{26})(3 \times 10^8)} \, \mathrm{kg}
\]
\[
m_g < 8 \times 10^{-68} \, \mathrm{kg}
\]

In energy units (\(\mathrm{eV}/c^2\)):
\[
m_g < 10^{-32} \, \mathrm{eV}/c^2
\]

This incredibly small mass corresponds to a Compton wavelength larger than the observable universe, meaning:
- Any exponential decay in gravity caused by a massive graviton would occur over distances far greater than we can measure.
- For practical purposes, gravity behaves as if the graviton is massless across all observable scales.

### **4. Why Is This Important?**
1. **Ensures Gravity’s Long-Range Nature**:
   - Observations of gravitational effects across galactic and cosmic scales require gravity to act effectively over vast distances.
   - If the graviton's Compton wavelength were shorter than the observable universe, we would see deviations from the inverse-square law at cosmological scales.

2. **Tests of Massive Gravity**:
   - Experiments and observations, such as gravitational wave signals and the behavior of galaxies, place constraints on the graviton’s mass.
   - If deviations from general relativity (e.g., suppressed gravity at large scales) are observed, they could hint at a nonzero graviton mass.

---

### **5. Key Takeaways**
- The Compton wavelength of a particle is inversely proportional to its mass and represents the "range" over which its effects are significant.
- For the graviton, a Compton wavelength larger than the observable universe corresponds to an extremely small mass (\(m_g < 10^{-32} \, \mathrm{eV}/c^2\)).
- This ensures that gravity behaves as a long-range force, consistent with observations across cosmic distances.
