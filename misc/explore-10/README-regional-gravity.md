Yes, exactly! If **gravity propagates at the speed of light (\(c\))**, there would have been a point in the early universe where gravitational interactions were indeed **regional** rather than **trans-universal**. This is a natural consequence of the finite speed of gravity and the rapid expansion of the universe. Let’s explore why this is the case and what it means.

---

### **1. The Finite Propagation Speed of Gravity**
- Gravity propagates at \(c\), the speed of light. This means:
  - Any gravitational influence from one region of spacetime can only affect regions within a **causal horizon**—the distance light (or gravitational waves) can travel since the beginning of the universe.
  - As the universe expands, the causal horizon increases, allowing gravity to influence larger regions over time.

---

### **2. The Causal Horizon in the Expanding Universe**
The **causal horizon** at any time \(t\) after the Big Bang is:
\[
R_c(t) = c \int_0^t \frac{1}{a(t')} \, dt'
\]
where:
- \(a(t)\): The scale factor of the universe, describing its expansion.
- \(R_c(t)\): The maximum distance over which gravitational effects could have propagated at time \(t\).

#### Early Universe:
- In the first moments after the Big Bang (\(t < 10^{-36} \, \mathrm{s}\)):
  - The causal horizon was incredibly small—on the order of subatomic distances, as spacetime was extremely dense and compact.
- As time progressed, the horizon expanded, but during **inflation** (\(t \sim 10^{-36} \, \mathrm{s}\)), the universe expanded exponentially, and regions were stretched far beyond each other's causal reach.

---

### **3. Regional Gravity During Inflation**
#### (a) **Pre-Inflation (\(t < 10^{-36} \, \mathrm{s}\)):**
- Gravity was local to regions no larger than the causal horizon, which was incredibly tiny.
- Interactions between particles were highly localized, and spacetime curvature was extreme and fluctuating.

#### (b) **During Inflation (\(t \sim 10^{-36} \, \mathrm{s}\)):**
- Inflation caused the universe to expand faster than the speed of light.
- Regions that were once causally connected were stretched apart, far beyond each other’s gravitational influence.
- Gravity became effectively **regional**, confined to small patches of the universe that remained within their local causal horizons.

#### (c) **After Inflation (\(t > 10^{-32} \, \mathrm{s}\)):**
- Once inflation ended, the expansion slowed, and the causal horizon began to grow again, allowing gravity to act over larger scales.

---

### **4. When Did Gravity Become Trans-Universe?**
The transition from regional to trans-universe gravity depends on the **scale of the observable universe** and the growth of the causal horizon:
- In the first fraction of a second, gravity was strictly regional.
- As the causal horizon grew (post-inflation), gravitational effects began to connect increasingly larger regions.
- By the time the universe was a few hundred thousand years old (around **recombination**, \(t \sim 380,000 \, \mathrm{years}\)), gravity had effectively connected most of the observable universe.

---

### **5. Implications of Regional Gravity**
#### (a) **Structure Formation**
- During the inflationary and early post-inflation periods, gravity was unable to connect distant regions.
- This lack of connection led to **localized density fluctuations**, which later served as seeds for galaxy and structure formation once gravity could act on larger scales.

#### (b) **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)**
- The uniformity of the CMB reflects the era when regions of the universe were still causally connected (before inflation stretched them apart).
- Gravity played a key role in amplifying initial quantum fluctuations into the density perturbations seen in the CMB.

#### (c) **Current Universe**
- In today’s universe, gravity operates over vast scales, but cosmic expansion (driven by dark energy) is creating a new kind of regionality:
  - Distant galaxies beyond the **cosmological horizon** are no longer gravitationally connected to us.

---

### **6. UFT Perspective on Regional Gravity**
In your Unified Field Theory framework:
1. **Field Interactions**:
   - Gravity, as a field interaction propagating at \(c\), would have been confined to local regions in the early universe.
   - These regions could exchange gravitational "information" only within their causal horizon.

2. **Relayed Gravity**:
   - As the universe expanded, gravity's influence might have been "relayed" through intermediate regions, gradually connecting larger areas as the causal horizon grew.

3. **Dynamic Evolution**:
   - Gravity may have transitioned from a purely local phenomenon to a global one as spacetime itself evolved, providing a unified explanation for how the early universe transitioned to its current structure.

---

### **7. Summary**
In the early universe, gravity was initially **regional** due to the finite speed of gravitational propagation and the rapid expansion of spacetime. During inflation, regions of the universe were stretched beyond each other's gravitational reach, effectively isolating them. As the causal horizon grew post-inflation, gravity connected increasingly larger regions, eventually becoming "trans-universe" and enabling the formation of large-scale cosmic structures.
