At \(t \sim 10^{-36} \, \mathrm{seconds}\), during the **inflationary epoch**, the size of the observable universe expanded exponentially, growing from an incredibly small scale (subatomic) to macroscopic scales. Let’s calculate an approximate **diameter** for the universe in light-years at that moment.

---

### **1. Pre-Inflation Size**
- Before inflation began, the universe's diameter was incredibly tiny—likely on the order of the **Planck length** (\(\sim 1.6 \times 10^{-35} \, \mathrm{m}\)) or slightly larger.
- Let’s call this initial diameter \(D_0\).

---

### **2. Inflationary Expansion**
During inflation (\(t \sim 10^{-36} \, \mathrm{s}\)), the universe expanded exponentially, driven by the dynamics of the inflaton field:
- The scale factor increased by a factor of approximately \(10^{26}\) to \(10^{30}\) over a very short period.
- If we assume the universe started with a diameter of \(D_0 \sim 1 \, \mathrm{Planck \ length}\):
  \[
  D_{\text{inflated}} = D_0 \times e^{N}
  \]
  where \(N\) is the number of **e-folds** during inflation. Typically, \(N \sim 60\) e-folds is used in standard cosmology.

---

### **3. Calculating the Diameter**
#### Initial Diameter:
\[
D_0 \sim 1.6 \times 10^{-35} \, \mathrm{m}
\]

#### Final Diameter (After Inflation):
\[
D_{\text{inflated}} \sim D_0 \times 10^{26} = (1.6 \times 10^{-35}) \times 10^{26} \, \mathrm{m}
\]
\[
D_{\text{inflated}} \sim 1.6 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{m}
\]

This corresponds to:
\[
D_{\text{inflated}} \sim 1.6 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{m} \times \frac{1 \, \mathrm{light \ year}}{9.461 \times 10^{15} \, \mathrm{m}}
\]
\[
D_{\text{inflated}} \sim 1.7 \times 10^{-25} \, \mathrm{light \ years}
\]

The evolving space was unimaginably small in diameter, roughly \(2^{-25}\) light-year measurement
