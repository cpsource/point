As the universe expands and stars or galaxies move farther away from us due to cosmic expansion, the **gravitational effect** we have on them (and they on us) depends on several factors tied to the nature of gravity and the universe's geometry. Let’s explore this step by step:

---

### **1. Gravitational Effects Across Expanding Distances**
#### Local Gravitational Effects:
- Gravity is an **inverse-square law** force:
  \[
  F = \frac{G m_1 m_2}{r^2}
  \]
  where \(r\) is the distance between two masses.
- As \(r\) increases, the force diminishes but never truly reaches zero. Thus, in principle, our gravitational pull on distant stars remains, though it becomes negligibly small.

#### Cosmic Expansion and Gravity:
- The universe’s expansion, described by the **Hubble-Lemaître Law** (\(v = H_0 d\)), only affects distances **beyond the scale of gravitationally bound systems**.
  - Local systems like the Milky Way or even galaxy clusters are not affected by the expansion because gravity dominates at smaller scales.

- At cosmic scales, the expansion can move objects apart faster than the speed of light (for sufficiently distant galaxies). Once objects cross this "cosmological event horizon," their light (and thus their influence) can no longer reach us.

---

### **2. Does Gravity Disappear Beyond the Horizon?**
The gravitational effect does not disappear but becomes **causally disconnected**:
1. **Causal Disconnect**:
   - If a star or galaxy moves beyond our cosmological event horizon, the gravitational interaction becomes effectively meaningless because no information about changes in the system can reach us.
   - For instance, if a star collapses into a black hole far beyond the horizon, we wouldn't feel the change—it’s as if the gravitational link "freezes."

2. **Gravitational Field Persistence**:
   - The gravitational field technically extends infinitely, so the "imprint" of an object's gravitational presence remains.
   - However, due to the vast expansion, any measurable influence becomes indistinguishably small.

---

### **3. The Role of Dark Energy**
- **Dark energy**, responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe, counteracts gravitational attraction at large scales.
- Over time, as expansion accelerates, distant stars and galaxies are pulled away faster than gravity can compensate, leaving systems like ours isolated.

---

### **4. What Happens to Gravity in the Far Future?**
#### Far Future of the Universe:
1. **Dark Energy Dominance**:
   - As the universe continues to expand, the **event horizon shrinks**, isolating gravitationally bound systems like galaxies or clusters.
   - Gravity will only operate meaningfully within such localized structures.

2. **Ultimate Gravitational Isolation**:
   - Even nearby galaxies in our local group may eventually merge into a single gravitationally bound object.
   - Beyond this, the universe becomes increasingly cold and empty, with gravitational effects beyond the local structure rendered irrelevant.

---

### **5. Philosophical Interpretation: Does Gravity "Disappear"?**
In a physical sense:
- Gravity doesn’t disappear; its effects persist indefinitely but become unmeasurable or irrelevant beyond certain cosmic scales.
In a practical sense:
- For distant stars and galaxies that cross the horizon, their gravitational influence **effectively disappears for us**, as no interaction can occur beyond the horizon.

---

### **6. Unified Field Theory (UFT) View**
In a UFT framework:
- Gravity might be interpreted as a field interaction extending through spacetime.
- As cosmic expansion stretches spacetime, the **gravitational field weakens and stretches**, analogous to how electromagnetic fields dilute with distance.
- However, gravitational fields remain "imprinted" on the fabric of spacetime, even if their interaction with us ceases.

---

### **Summary**
The gravitational effect we have on distant stars doesn’t disappear entirely but becomes causally irrelevant as cosmic expansion moves them beyond our event horizon. Locally, gravity remains meaningful within bound systems like our galaxy, while at cosmological scales, dark energy increasingly dominates. The universe’s expansion ensures that gravitational connections weaken and effectively vanish at extreme distances, leaving us in eventual isolation.
