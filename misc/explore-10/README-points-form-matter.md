Your idea provides a fascinating lens to explore the emergence of matter, structure, and gravity in the universe. Here's how this theory could be expanded:

---

### **1. The Birth of Points and Their Energy**
In your framework, **points** are born during or just after the Big Bang with:
1. **A Fixed Energy Budget**:
   - Each point carries a specific amount of energy, representing its potential to interact with others and influence spacetime.
2. **Dynamic Behavior**:
   - Points wander through spacetime, driven by their energy and influenced by local field conditions.

---

### **2. Interaction of Points**
#### **Stable Configurations**
- When points interact, they can form **stable configurations**, such as:
  - Bound systems (analogous to atoms or molecules in classical physics).
  - Clusters that amplify gravitational effects by concentrating mass/energy in one location.
- These configurations would generate **persistent gravitational fields**, curving spacetime and attracting other points.

#### **Unstable Configurations**
- In some cases, points may collide or briefly interact but fail to form stable configurations.
- These unstable interactions could produce **short bursts of gravitational waves**:
  - The interaction perturbs spacetime locally, emitting gravity as a "squirt" before the points separate or dissipate.

---

### **3. Emission of Gravity**
#### (a) **From Stable Configurations**:
- Stable configurations generate **continuous gravitational fields**:
  - These fields are proportional to the energy and mass of the configuration.
  - As more points join a configuration, the gravitational influence grows, creating regions of spacetime curvature that seed large-scale structures.

#### (b) **From Unstable Configurations**:
- When unstable configurations form and decay:
  - The process emits **gravitational waves**, carrying energy away as ripples in spacetime.
  - These "gravitational squirts" act as transient signals, leaving an imprint on the surrounding environment.

---

### **4. Theoretical Framework**
Your theory could be described in terms of:
1. **Point Dynamics**:
   - Points follow trajectories influenced by their energy, initial velocity, and local spacetime curvature.
2. **Field Interactions**:
   - Points interact with other points via:
     - **Short-range forces**: Governing binding and collision behaviors.
     - **Long-range gravity**: Evolving from stable configurations or transient bursts.

3. **Stable vs. Unstable Configurations**:
   - Stable configurations minimize energy and persist, acting as gravitational attractors.
   - Unstable configurations are transient, dissipating energy through gravitational waves.

---

### **5. Evolution of Structure**
#### **Early Universe**:
- Points begin as independent entities in a high-energy environment, wandering in a chaotic field.
- Interactions between points form the seeds of gravitational wells, concentrating energy and matter.

#### **Formation of Stable Configurations**:
- Over time, points coalesce into stable systems:
  - These could evolve into particles, galaxies, and other cosmic structures.
  - Gravitational fields from these configurations amplify local density variations, leading to structure formation.

#### **Unstable Configurations and Gravitational Waves**:
- Unstable interactions could generate the **primordial gravitational wave background**, detectable today as ripples in spacetime.

---

### **6. Observable Implications**
Your theory suggests several phenomena that could be observed:
1. **Gravitational Wave Background**:
   - Early interactions between points could produce a stochastic gravitational wave background, distinct from inflationary waves.
   - These waves might encode information about the early universe's energy distribution.

2. **Lumpy Spacetime**:
   - The uneven distribution of points and their gravitational fields could explain the **lumpiness of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)**.

3. **Transient Gravitational Events**:
   - Unstable point interactions might leave localized distortions or waves in spacetime, observable through advanced gravitational wave detectors.

---

### **7. Connections to Current Theories**
#### **Unified Field Theory (UFT) Perspective**:
- Points could represent **localized excitations** of the unified field, with their interactions mediated by underlying field dynamics.
- The transition between stable and unstable configurations might reflect resonance phenomena in the field.

#### **Relation to Quantum Field Theory**:
- Points might correspond to quantum particles, with interactions described by probabilistic wavefunctions.
- Gravitational squirts could parallel quantum tunneling events or virtual particle annihilation.

#### **Comparison with Dark Matter and Energy**:
- Stable point configurations might contribute to visible matter, while "invisible" stable or transient configurations could explain dark matter and dark energy phenomena.

---

### **8. Mathematical Description**
Your theory could be formalized with:
1. **Equations of Motion for Points**:
   - Points obey dynamics influenced by potential fields, local spacetime curvature, and mutual interactions.
   \[
   \frac{d^2 x^i}{dt^2} = -\nabla \Phi(x)
   \]
   where \(\Phi(x)\) represents the potential field created by other points.

2. **Field Evolution**:
   - Stable configurations generate persistent gravitational fields:
     \[
     \nabla^2 \Phi = 4 \pi G \rho
     \]
     where \(\rho\) is the energy density of the configuration.

3. **Transient Gravitational Waves**:
   - Unstable interactions emit gravitational waves described by:
     \[
     h_{\mu\nu} = \frac{4G}{c^4} \frac{\ddot{Q}_{\mu\nu}}{r}
     \]
     where \(Q_{\mu\nu}\) is the quadrupole moment of the system.

---

### **9. Summary**
Your theory posits that **points, born with specific energy from the Big Bang**, interact dynamically, forming both stable and unstable configurations. Stable configurations generate persistent gravitational fields, while unstable ones emit bursts of gravitational energy. These processes seed the universe's structure and contribute to observable phenomena like gravitational waves and CMB anisotropies.
