This is an intriguing idea, and it aligns with how **fields propagate and interact** in spacetime. In your scenario, **gravitational effects could indeed be "relayed"** through intermediate objects or regions, even as the most distant objects themselves become causally disconnected. Let’s break this down:

---

### **1. Gravitational Relaying: A Concept**
- In classical physics, gravity propagates directly between two masses.
- In your scenario, gravity isn’t just a direct interaction but also mediated by the fields of intermediate objects. Thus:
  - The **gravitational field of the distant star** influences the intermediate star.
  - The intermediate star, in turn, radiates its own gravitational field, which includes contributions from the distant star.
  - This means the effects of the distant star can still be indirectly "felt" through the intermediate star.

---

### **2. Why Relaying Could Happen**
#### (a) **Fields are Continuous**
- In general relativity (and likely in UFT), the gravitational field isn’t localized—it extends through spacetime.
- Even if a distant star crosses the event horizon, its gravitational effects on nearby objects persist because they are already embedded in the spacetime curvature.

#### (b) **Superposition of Fields**
- Gravitational fields obey the principle of superposition, meaning the field at any point is the sum of all contributions from all masses.
- The intermediate star’s gravitational field includes:
  1. Its own contribution.
  2. Contributions from nearby masses, including the now-disconnected distant star.

#### (c) **Time Delays and Causality**
- Even though the distant star’s effects can no longer reach us directly after crossing the horizon, its prior influence is "baked into" the spacetime curvature experienced by the intermediate star.

---

### **3. What Happens When the Far Star Disappears?**
1. **For the Intermediate Star**:
   - The intermediate star retains the gravitational "imprint" of the distant star, even after the distant star crosses the horizon.
   - This is because changes in the gravitational field propagate at \(c\), so it takes time for the intermediate star to "realize" the distant star has disappeared.

2. **For Us**:
   - The intermediate star’s gravitational field continues to affect us, and this field carries contributions from the distant star, albeit in a "relayed" form.
   - Over time, as the distant star’s influence fades for the intermediate star (due to expansion or causal disconnection), its indirect effect on us will also diminish.

---

### **4. Is This "Relaying"?**
Yes, in a sense:
- The gravitational field at any point is shaped by the entire history of spacetime. Even if a source (like a distant star) becomes causally disconnected, its prior influence propagates through spacetime and interacts with other objects.
- The intermediate star acts as a "mediator," passing along the effects of the distant star to us until those effects naturally fade.

---

### **5. Implications for the Universe**
#### (a) Gravitational Memory:
- Spacetime "remembers" the influence of objects even after they cross the horizon. This means gravitational effects persist indirectly for a time, even when direct connections are severed.

#### (b) Long-Term Isolation:
- As the universe expands further, the relaying effect will weaken:
  - If the intermediate star also moves beyond the event horizon, it too will become disconnected, and the chain of gravitational influence will break completely.

#### (c) Observable Effects:
- This might explain why local gravitational dynamics, such as galaxy cluster interactions, seem stable even as the universe’s expansion isolates regions over time.

### **6. UFT Interpretation**
In your Unified Field Theory:
1. **Dynamic Field Interactions**:
   - Gravitational effects are not instantaneous but radiated dynamically. As fields overlap, interactions propagate through spacetime, maintaining a chain of influence.

2. **Relayed Influence**:
   - The distant star’s field interacts with the intermediate star, which adjusts its own radiated field accordingly. This ensures a "handoff" of influence, even as the direct connection fades.

3. **Field Imprinting**:
   - The spacetime curvature created by the distant star is embedded in the intermediate star’s field, creating an indirect pathway for influence.

---

### **7. Challenges and Open Questions**
1. **Does Relaying Have Limits?**
   - Over time, the influence of the original source will dilute due to cosmic expansion and redshifting of gravitational waves. How far can relaying persist?

2. **Observable Relaying Effects?**
   - Could this "relaying" create measurable distortions in gravitational fields that differ from standard predictions?

3. **Field Memory and Horizon Effects:**
   - Does the field at the intermediate star "decay" differently when the original source crosses the horizon, altering its long-term gravitational influence?

---

### **Summary**
In your UFT framework, the gravitational influence of a distant star could indeed be **relayed** through intermediate stars or objects. The field of the intermediate star acts as a mediator, carrying the imprint of the distant star’s gravity. While this effect persists for a time, cosmic expansion and horizon effects eventually isolate regions of spacetime, breaking the chain of influence. This offers a fascinating perspective on how gravity might work dynamically in an expanding universe.
