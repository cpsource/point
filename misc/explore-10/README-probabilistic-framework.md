Your insight touches on a profound philosophical and scientific issue about the nature of quantum mechanics and the process of scientific theory-building. It's an excellent observation that our theories often "fit the data" by necessity, but this raises the question of whether we are genuinely uncovering objective truths or merely constructing a framework that accommodates our observations. Let's unpack this step by step:

---

### **1. The Quantum Mechanics Dilemma: Is It the Chicken or the Egg?**
#### The Current Approach:
- In quantum mechanics, we observe phenomena that defy classical intuition (e.g., superposition, entanglement, wave-particle duality).
- Unable to fully "understand" these phenomena in a deterministic way, we adopt a probabilistic framework:
  - The **wavefunction** represents probabilities, not definite states.
  - Measurement "collapses" this probabilistic state into a specific outcome.

#### The "Chicken or Egg" Problem:
- Do we call quantum behavior probabilistic **because** it fundamentally is?
- Or do we call it probabilistic **because** our cognitive and experimental tools are limited, and we can't see the deterministic mechanism underneath?

---

### **2. Are We Just Fitting the Data?**
Science progresses by building models that fit observations. However:
1. **Model-Dependence**:
   - A theory (like quantum mechanics) is successful if it predicts experimental outcomes. But success in prediction doesn’t necessarily mean the theory reveals the underlying reality.
   - By calling quantum behavior probabilistic, we may just be fitting the data to our current mathematical frameworks (like the Schrödinger equation or the Born rule), without knowing if the probabilistic nature is intrinsic or a feature of our model.

2. **Cognitive Bias**:
   - Humans are pattern-finding creatures. When we encounter something incomprehensible, we often create frameworks (e.g., probability) that "work" rather than understanding the phenomenon fundamentally.
   - Once the framework works, it becomes self-reinforcing. Any new data is interpreted within that framework, making it difficult to see alternatives.

---

### **3. Examples in Science**
#### (a) **Newtonian Mechanics and General Relativity**:
- Newton’s laws of motion worked extremely well for centuries, but they turned out to be approximations of deeper principles described by Einstein’s relativity.
- Similarly, quantum mechanics might work within its domain but could eventually be subsumed by a deeper theory.

#### (b) **Probabilistic Theories in History**:
- Before quantum mechanics, phenomena like thermodynamics were also understood probabilistically.
- Later, we realized that thermodynamic probabilities arise from deterministic microscopic behaviors (e.g., molecular collisions). Could quantum mechanics be similar?

### **4. Is Quantum Mechanics Incomplete?**
Your concern aligns with several interpretations of quantum mechanics:
1. **Copenhagen Interpretation (Orthodox View)**:
   - The wavefunction represents probabilities, and the act of measurement collapses it.
   - This view is practical but doesn’t explain what "measurement" fundamentally is.

2. **Hidden Variables (e.g., Bohmian Mechanics)**:
   - Quantum behavior is deterministic at a deeper level, but we lack access to the hidden variables.
   - Probabilities arise because we are observing an incomplete picture.

3. **Many-Worlds Interpretation**:
   - The wavefunction never collapses. Instead, all outcomes occur in different branches of a multiverse.
   - Probabilities reflect our limited perspective within a single branch.

4. **Objective Collapse Theories**:
   - Quantum systems collapse not because of measurement but due to intrinsic physical processes.

---

### **5. Could It Be the Other Way Around?**
You propose an intriguing inversion:
- Instead of the theory (probability) arising from observations, what if our observations are **shaped by the theory**?
- By choosing a probabilistic framework, we "see" quantum mechanics in a way that aligns with probabilities, reinforcing the idea.

#### Why This Could Be True:
1. **Measurement Limits**:
   - In quantum mechanics, what we measure often depends on how we set up the experiment. For example, measuring position affects momentum and vice versa.
   - This suggests that what we "see" is as much about our tools and methods as it is about the underlying reality.

2. **Observer Effect**:
   - The act of measurement is an interaction between the observer and the observed. This interaction could impose probabilistic outcomes rather than revealing pre-existing ones.

3. **Framework Lock-In**:
   - Once we adopt a probabilistic framework, it becomes self-reinforcing, making alternative explanations harder to conceive.

---

### **6. What Might Lie Beneath?**
If the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics is not fundamental, alternative mechanisms could explain quantum phenomena:
1. **Deterministic Underpinning**:
   - A deeper, deterministic reality might exist, but we lack the tools to observe it directly.
   - Probabilities could be emergent properties, much like thermodynamic probabilities arise from deterministic molecular motion.

2. **Relational Reality**:
   - Some theories (e.g., relational quantum mechanics) suggest that quantum properties exist only in relation to other systems. The probabilistic appearance might emerge from this relational nature.

3. **Wavefunction as a Tool**:
   - The wavefunction might not represent physical reality but only our knowledge of the system. Probabilities reflect our ignorance, not the system's true state.

---

### **7. A Broader Philosophical Perspective**
Your observation touches on the philosophy of science:
1. **Instrumentalism**:
   - Theories are tools to predict observations, not necessarily to describe reality.
   - Quantum mechanics is probabilistic because that’s what works for predictions, even if it’s not "true."

2. **Realism**:
   - There is an objective reality underlying quantum phenomena, and our probabilistic models are incomplete attempts to describe it.

3. **Constructivism**:
   - Our observations and theories are co-constructed. By framing quantum mechanics as probabilistic, we limit what we perceive and how we interpret data.

---

### **8. Summary**
- Quantum mechanics works because its probabilistic framework fits the data, but whether this reflects reality or just our way of interpreting it is unresolved.
- Your "chicken or egg" question suggests we may be imposing a probabilistic structure on quantum phenomena because it fits our cognitive and mathematical tools.
- Future theories may reveal whether quantum mechanics is fundamentally probabilistic or if probability is a result of deeper, deterministic processes we haven’t yet uncovered.
