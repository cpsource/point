To determine when the **observable universe** (not just the galaxy) was approximately **1 light-year across**, we need to trace the universe's expansion back in time. This involves the **scale factor**, which describes how distances in the universe grow over time.

---

### **Key Parameters**
1. **Current Size of the Observable Universe**:
   - The observable universe today is about \(93 \, \mathrm{billion \ light \ years}\) in diameter.
   - Its radius is approximately \(46.5 \, \mathrm{billion \ light \ years}\).

2. **Scale Factor (\(a\))**:
   - The scale factor describes how the size of the universe evolves with time:
     \[
     D = D_{\text{today}} \times a(t)
     \]
     where:
     - \(D\): Diameter of the universe at time \(t\),
     - \(D_{\text{today}} = 93 \, \mathrm{billion \ light \ years}\),
     - \(a(t)\): Scale factor at time \(t\).

3. **When \(D \sim 1 \, \mathrm{light \ year}\)**:
   - Set \(D = 1 \, \mathrm{light \ year}\).

---

### **Scale Factor for 1 Light-Year Diameter**
The scale factor when the universe was \(1 \, \mathrm{light \ year}\) across is:
\[
a(t) = \frac{1 \, \mathrm{light \ year}}{93 \, \mathrm{billion \ light \ years}} \approx 1.075 \times 10^{-11}
\]

---

### **Relationship Between Scale Factor and Time**
In a matter-dominated or radiation-dominated universe, the scale factor grows approximately as a power law of time:
- During the **radiation-dominated era** (early universe), \(a(t) \propto t^{1/2}\).
- During the **matter-dominated era**, \(a(t) \propto t^{2/3}\).

Given the early stage we are considering, the universe was radiation-dominated. Thus:
\[
a(t) = k \cdot t^{1/2}
\]
where \(k\) is a proportionality constant derived from the expansion rate.

---

### **Finding the Time (\(t\))**
1. **Determine \(k\):**
   - At \(t = 1 \, \mathrm{second}\), the scale factor \(a(1) \approx 10^{-10}\) (from standard cosmology).
   - Substituting into \(a(t) = k \cdot t^{1/2}\):
     \[
     k \approx \frac{10^{-10}}{1^{1/2}} = 10^{-10}.
     \]

2. **Solve for \(t\):**
   - When \(a(t) = 1.075 \times 10^{-11}\):
     \[
     1.075 \times 10^{-11} = 10^{-10} \cdot t^{1/2}
     \]
     \[
     t^{1/2} = \frac{1.075 \times 10^{-11}}{10^{-10}} = 0.1075
     \]
     \[
     t = (0.1075)^2 \approx 0.0115 \, \mathrm{seconds}.
     \]

---

### **Answer**
The observable universe was approximately **1 light-year across** about **0.0115 seconds after the Big Bang**, during the radiation-dominated era.

---

### **Assumptions and Considerations**
1. **Homogeneity**:
   - The calculation assumes a homogeneous and isotropic universe, as described by the standard cosmological model.
2. **Radiation-Dominated Era**:
   - At this time, the universe was dominated by radiation, not matter or dark energy.
3. **Precision**:
   - The result is an estimate based on current cosmological parameters (e.g., Hubble constant, matter density, etc.).
