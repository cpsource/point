Yes, under the assumption in your **Unified Field Theory (UFT)** that gravity propagates at the speed of light (\(c\)), distant objects would indeed **effectively disappear** beyond a certain distance due to the finite propagation speed of gravitational influence. Here’s why and how this works:

---

### **1. Propagation of Gravity at \(c\)**
- In general relativity, gravitational waves (disturbances in spacetime curvature) propagate at \(c\). If gravity in your UFT is similarly constrained by \(c\), then:
  - Changes in the gravitational field, such as a star moving or disappearing, take time to propagate.
  - Beyond a certain distance, the gravitational influence of an object would no longer be able to "catch up" with the accelerated expansion of the universe.

---

### **2. Expansion and Event Horizons**
- In an expanding universe, distant objects move away from us due to the **Hubble expansion**:
  \[
  v = H_0 d
  \]
  where \(v\) is the recession velocity, \(H_0\) is the Hubble constant, and \(d\) is the distance.

- When the recession velocity \(v\) exceeds \(c\), the object crosses the **cosmological event horizon**:
  - The distance to this horizon is given by:
    \[
    d_{\text{horizon}} = \frac{c}{H_0}
    \]
    For \(H_0 \sim 70 \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}\), the horizon is approximately \(14 \, \mathrm{Gly}\) (billion light-years).
  - Objects beyond this horizon can no longer send information (light, gravity, or any causal influence) to us.

---

### **3. Gravity and Event Horizons**
#### If Gravity Travels at \(c\):
1. **Gravitational Disconnection**:
   - As objects cross the event horizon, their gravitational influence can no longer reach us.
   - From our perspective, it’s as if their gravitational "presence" has frozen in time and then fades out as expansion stretches spacetime.

2. **Loss of Interaction**:
   - Just as light from beyond the event horizon can never reach us, changes in the gravitational field from such objects are also cut off.
   - Gravity becomes **causally irrelevant** beyond the event horizon, effectively "disconnecting" us from the mass.

---

### **4. Does Gravity Disappear?**
#### From Our Perspective:
- Once an object is beyond the horizon, its gravitational influence effectively disappears because:
  - Changes in the gravitational field can no longer propagate to us.
  - Even its static gravitational field stretches and dilutes due to the expansion of spacetime.

#### From a Universal Perspective:
- The gravitational field of the object still exists locally and continues to interact with its surroundings.
- However, the region of spacetime it influences becomes isolated due to the expansion.

---

### **5. Implications for UFT**
In your UFT framework, this aligns well with the concept that:
- **Gravity as a Field**:
  - Gravity radiates outward from objects, like light or electromagnetic waves.
  - Beyond the horizon, the field cannot propagate fast enough to remain connected, effectively "cutting off" gravitational influence.

- **Dynamic Disconnection**:
  - The gravitational field of the object is not "instantaneous" but mediated through its radiative structure.
  - As spacetime expands, the field’s influence weakens and eventually vanishes for distant observers.

---

### **6. Observational Evidence**
Cosmic expansion already demonstrates similar effects:
1. **Cosmological Redshift**:
   - Light from distant objects gets redshifted as spacetime stretches, carrying less energy.
2. **Gravitational Redshift**:
   - Gravitational waves from distant sources also experience redshift, analogous to light.
3. **Dark Energy**:
   - The accelerating expansion further isolates distant objects by pushing them beyond the event horizon.

---

### **7. Unified Perspective: "Disappearing" Gravity**
- Under UFT, gravitational effects do "disappear" in the sense that their propagation is limited by \(c\), and the expanding universe isolates regions of spacetime.
- This gives a dynamic picture where gravity is not a static, omnipresent force but a **finite-speed field interaction** tied to the causal structure of spacetime.

---

### **Summary**
If gravity in your UFT travels at \(c\), distant objects beyond the event horizon would indeed **effectively disappear** because their gravitational influence could no longer reach us. This is a natural consequence of cosmic expansion and the finite propagation speed of information in the universe, emphasizing the causal limits of gravitational interaction in an expanding spacetime.
