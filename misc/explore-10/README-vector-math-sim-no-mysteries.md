You're absolutely right—adding "mystery" properties to entities in a simulation is a **shortcut that avoids the deeper question**: how do these properties arise from **first principles**? To maintain the integrity of your framework, every property or rule in the simulation must be **derived from fundamental behaviors** of the simplest entities (e.g., points). This approach not only aligns with your philosophy but also enhances the robustness and credibility of your model.

Here’s how we can approach this challenge of **deriving everything from fundamentals**:

---

### **1. Start with Truly Fundamental Entities: Points**
#### What Are Points?
- **Points** are the simplest units in your simulation.
- They have no intrinsic properties (e.g., no mass, charge, or spin) at the outset.
- Any properties they exhibit (e.g., clustering, attraction, or influence) must **emerge from their interactions or relationships** with other points.

#### Example:
- Instead of assuming points have "mass" or "charge," define their behavior as:
  - Points interact via rules like distance minimization, resonance, or propagation of influence.
  - Observable properties like "mass" or "charge" emerge as by-products of these interactions.

---

### **2. Derive Interaction Rules from First Principles**
#### What Can Points Do?
To stay fundamental, define only a **few basic actions** for points:
1. **Exist**:
   - Points occupy a position in space and time: \(\mathbf{r}_i(t)\).
2. **Move**:
   - Points change their position over time according to some influence: \(\mathbf{v}_i = \frac{d\mathbf{r}_i}{dt}\).
3. **Interact**:
   - Points influence each other based on distance, velocity, or other factors.

#### How to Derive Interaction Rules:
1. **Symmetry**:
   - Require that interactions respect fundamental symmetries (e.g., translational invariance, isotropy of space):
     - The interaction rule should depend only on relative positions, not absolute coordinates.
     - Example: An interaction force that depends on the vector \((\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i)\) respects this symmetry.
   
2. **Causality**:
   - Interactions should propagate at finite speeds to avoid violating causality.
     - Example: Influence propagates through a wave-like mechanism.

3. **Minimization Principles**:
   - Define rules that minimize energy, tension, or other fundamental quantities:
     - Example: Points tend to align or cluster to minimize local potential energy.

### **3. Build Properties as Emergent Effects**
Instead of assigning properties like "mass" or "charge," allow them to **emerge naturally**:
1. **Mass**:
   - Mass could emerge as a measure of how strongly a point influences others or resists motion.
   - Example:
     \[
     m_i = \int \Phi(\mathbf{r}) d\mathbf{r}
     \]
     - Here, \(\Phi(\mathbf{r})\) is a field generated by the point’s interactions.

2. **Charge**:
   - Charge might arise as a topological feature of a point's interaction network (e.g., a net imbalance in connections or influences).

3. **Gravitational Effects**:
   - Gravitational-like behavior could result from points collectively curving the "influence field" they create.

---

### **4. Simulate Step by Step**
#### Iterative Simulation:
Let’s say points follow only a basic interaction rule, such as:
\[
\mathbf{F}_{ij} = f(r_{ij}) \cdot \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}
\]
Where:
- \(r_{ij} = \|\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i\|\) is the distance between points.
- \(f(r_{ij})\) is a simple function (e.g., attraction or repulsion based on distance).
- \(\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}\) is the unit vector along \((\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i)\).

#### Emergent Properties:
Run the simulation iteratively:
1. Points interact locally based on \(f(r_{ij})\).
2. Clustering, alignment, or wave-like behavior emerges.
3. Quantify these emergent behaviors to interpret them as "mass," "charge," or "gravity."

---

### **5. Example: Gravity Without Adding Mass**
Here’s an outline for deriving gravity-like effects step by step:
1. **Start with Basic Rules**:
   - Points interact via a distance-dependent force:
     \[
     \mathbf{F}_{ij} = -\frac{k}{r_{ij}^3} \cdot (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i)
     \]
   - No explicit "mass" is assigned; \(k\) is just a scaling constant.

2. **Run the Simulation**:
   - Points move under the influence of forces from nearby points.
   - Clusters form naturally where the forces balance out.

3. **Measure Emergent Behavior**:
   - Clusters appear to exert a net "pull" on nearby points.
   - Define this pull as an emergent **gravitational effect**.

4. **Interpret as Mass**:
   - Quantify the strength of a cluster’s pull:
     \[
     M_{\text{cluster}} = \sum_{i \in \text{cluster}} \|\mathbf{F}_i\|
     \]
   - This is the emergent "mass" of the cluster.

---

### **6. Advantages of This Approach**
1. **No Arbitrary Assumptions**:
   - By deriving properties step by step, you avoid introducing "mystery" quantities like mass or charge.

2. **Scalable**:
   - Fundamental rules apply equally to all points, regardless of scale.

3. **Insightful**:
   - Emergent properties reveal how complex behaviors arise from simple principles.

---

### **7. Challenges and How to Address Them**
1. **Defining Fundamental Rules**:
   - Ensure rules are truly fundamental and minimal (e.g., based on symmetry or energy minimization).

2. **Emergent Behavior is Unpredictable**:
   - Simulations might not immediately produce recognizable phenomena. Iterative refinement of rules may be necessary.

3. **Validation**:
   - Ensure that emergent properties match known physical behaviors (e.g., gravity or clustering dynamics).

---

### **8. Summary**
- **Start from scratch**: Use only fundamental behaviors like movement, interaction, and distance dependence for points.
- **Let properties emerge**: Allow mass, charge, or gravity-like behavior to arise naturally from local interactions.
- **Iterate and refine**: Run simulations, observe emergent phenomena, and adjust the rules if needed.

This approach keeps the framework clean and principled while allowing for rich emergent behaviors. Would you like to refine specific rules or test this with a practical simulation example?
