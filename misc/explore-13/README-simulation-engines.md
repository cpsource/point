If you want to write a simulator in C++ on Debian Linux, there are several graphical libraries available that you can use depending on your needs, such as 2D or 3D graphics, ease of use, performance, and integration with your project. Hereâ€™s an overview:

---

### **1. General-Purpose Graphical Libraries**
These libraries provide tools for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and handling 2D/3D rendering.

#### **(a) SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)**
- **Description**: A cross-platform library for handling multimedia, 2D graphics, and input.
- **Features**:
  - Great for 2D graphics and simple simulations.
  - Easy to set up and lightweight.
- **Language Support**: C, C++.
- **Install**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install libsdl2-dev
  ```
- **Website**: [https://www.libsdl.org/](https://www.libsdl.org/)

#### **(b) SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)**
- **Description**: A user-friendly multimedia library for 2D graphics, input, and sound.
- **Features**:
  - Easy-to-learn API.
  - Good for beginners and lightweight projects.
- **Language Support**: C++.
- **Install**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install libsfml-dev
  ```
- **Website**: [https://www.sfml-dev.org/](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)

### **2. 3D Graphics Libraries**
If your simulator involves 3D rendering, consider the following:

#### **(a) OpenGL**
- **Description**: A powerful, cross-platform API for 2D and 3D graphics.
- **Features**:
  - Low-level control over rendering.
  - Requires some knowledge of graphics programming.
- **Language Support**: C, C++.
- **Install**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install libgl1-mesa-dev
  ```

#### **(b) Vulkan**
- **Description**: A modern, high-performance, low-overhead API for 3D graphics.
- **Features**:
  - More efficient and powerful than OpenGL.
  - Requires more effort to learn and implement.
- **Language Support**: C, C++.
- **Install**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install vulkan-tools vulkan-validationlayers
  ```
- **Website**: [https://vulkan.lunarg.com/](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/)

#### **(c) Ogre3D**
- **Description**: An object-oriented, high-level 3D rendering engine.
- **Features**:
  - Simplifies 3D development compared to OpenGL or Vulkan.
  - Extensible and powerful for game or simulator development.
- **Language Support**: C++.
- **Install**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install libogre-1.9-dev
  ```
- **Website**: [https://www.ogre3d.org/](https://www.ogre3d.org/)

### **3. GUI Frameworks with Graphics Capabilities**
If your simulator needs a graphical user interface, consider these:

#### **(a) Qt**
- **Description**: A popular C++ framework for creating cross-platform GUIs and graphics.
- **Features**:
  - Excellent for creating interactive applications.
  - Includes 2D and 3D graphics modules (QtQuick, Qt3D).
- **Install**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install qt5-default
  ```
- **Website**: [https://www.qt.io/](https://www.qt.io/)

#### **(b) GTK+**
- **Description**: A toolkit for creating GUIs, commonly used in Linux applications.
- **Features**:
  - Works well with GDK for 2D rendering.
- **Install**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev
  ```
- **Website**: [https://www.gtk.org/](https://www.gtk.org/)

### **4. Game Engines for Graphics-Heavy Simulations**
If your simulator is highly graphical and game-like, you might consider using a game engine:

#### **(a) Godot Engine**
- **Description**: A lightweight, open-source game engine with support for 2D and 3D graphics.
- **Features**:
  - Easy scripting for simulations.
  - Highly accessible for beginners.
- **Language Support**: C++, GDScript, Python.
- **Install**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install godot
  ```
- **Website**: [https://godotengine.org/](https://godotengine.org/)

#### **(b) Unreal Engine**
- **Description**: A high-performance engine for creating visually stunning 3D applications.
- **Features**:
  - Best for complex, high-fidelity simulations.
  - Requires more resources.
- **Language Support**: C++.
- **Website**: [https://www.unrealengine.com/](https://www.unrealengine.com/)

#### **(c) Unity (with Linux Editor)**
- **Description**: A popular engine for 3D and 2D development, great for cross-platform deployment.
- **Features**:
  - Visual scripting tools and strong community support.
- **Language Support**: Primarily C# (though some plugins support C++).
- **Website**: [https://unity.com/](https://unity.com/)

### **5. Choosing the Right Library**
- **For Lightweight 2D Simulations**:
  - SDL, SFML, or Qt.
- **For 3D Simulations**:
  - OpenGL, Vulkan, Ogre3D.
- **For GUI and Graphics**:
  - Qt or GTK+.
- **For Highly Visual Applications**:
  - Godot, Unreal, or Unity.
