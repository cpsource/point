**Eigen** is a high-performance C++ library for linear algebra that supports operations such as matrices, vectors, numerical solvers, and more. It is widely used for scientific computing, simulations, computer graphics, machine learning, and optimization tasks due to its versatility and ease of integration into C++ projects. Eigen is highly optimized for both small and large-scale computations, providing features like dense and sparse matrix operations, decomposition methods (e.g., LU, QR, SVD), and support for custom scalar types. Its header-only design eliminates the need for complex installation, making it lightweight and convenient to use. Eigen is open-source and maintained by a vibrant community, ensuring regular updates and enhancements.
