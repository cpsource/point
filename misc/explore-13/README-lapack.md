The **Linear Algebra PACKage (LAPACK)** is a comprehensive software library written in Fortran, designed to solve a wide array of linear algebra problems, including systems of linear equations, linear least squares solutions, eigenvalue problems, and singular value decomposition. It also provides routines for various matrix factorizations such as LU, QR, and Cholesky. The official LAPACK development repository is hosted on GitHub, offering the Fortran source code, testing programs, and a reference implementation of the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS). This repository facilitates collaboration and contributions from the community, ensuring that LAPACK remains a robust and efficient tool for numerical linear algebra computations.
