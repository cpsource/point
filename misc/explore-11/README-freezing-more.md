If you have frozen water at \( 32^\circ \text{F} \) and cool it further to \( 20^\circ \text{F} \), the process **absorbs energy from the environment**. Here's why:

---

### **1. Cooling Below the Freezing Point**
- At \( 32^\circ \text{F} \), the water is in its **solid state (ice)**.
- Cooling ice from \( 32^\circ \text{F} \) to \( 20^\circ \text{F} \) does not involve a phase change—it remains a solid throughout.
- The temperature decrease means the **kinetic energy of the ice molecules decreases**, and the system must lose thermal energy for this cooling to happen.

---

### **2. Energy Absorption**
- The ice **absorbs energy** from the cooling mechanism (e.g., a freezer) to lower its temperature further.
- The amount of energy absorbed depends on the specific heat capacity of ice, which is approximately:
  \[
  c_{\text{ice}} \approx 2.1 \, \text{J/g·K}.
  \]

#### **Energy Calculation**:
- Suppose you have \( m \) grams of ice cooled from \( T_1 = 32^\circ \text{F} \) to \( T_2 = 20^\circ \text{F} \):
  1. Convert temperatures to Celsius: \( 32^\circ \text{F} = 0^\circ \text{C} \), \( 20^\circ \text{F} \approx -6.67^\circ \text{C} \).
  2. Temperature change: \( \Delta T = T_2 - T_1 = -6.67 - 0 = -6.67 \, \text{K}. \)
  3. Energy absorbed:
     \[
     Q = m \cdot c_{\text{ice}} \cdot \Delta T.
     \]
     For \( m = 100 \, \text{g} \):
     \[
     Q = 100 \cdot 2.1 \cdot (-6.67) = -1400.7 \, \text{J}.
     \]
     The negative sign indicates heat loss by the ice, meaning the surroundings absorb energy.

---

### **3. Key Difference: Cooling vs. Freezing**
- During **freezing**, energy is released because the phase change reduces internal energy.
- During **cooling of a solid (below freezing)**, energy is **absorbed** from the surroundings to decrease the temperature.

---

### **4. Summary**
- Cooling frozen water from \( 32^\circ \text{F} \) to \( 20^\circ \text{F} \):
  - Does not involve a phase change.
  - **Absorbs energy** to lower the kinetic energy of the ice molecules.
- This energy absorption depends on the specific heat capacity of ice and the mass of the sample.
