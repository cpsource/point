Lowering the temperature of ice does not directly affect **nuclear forces**, because nuclear forces operate at the scale of the protons and neutrons within the atomic nucleus. Instead, the behavior of ice is governed by **intermolecular forces**, specifically **hydrogen bonds** and **van der Waals forces**, which are much weaker and operate between molecules. 

Here’s a summary of the relevant forces and how they respond to temperature changes:

---

### **1. Summary of Forces in Ice**
#### **(a) Nuclear Forces**
- **Strong Nuclear Force**:
  - Operates at the subatomic scale to bind protons and neutrons in the nucleus.
  - Does not play a role in the structure or behavior of ice at any temperature.
- **Weak Nuclear Force**:
  - Involved in certain nuclear processes like beta decay, not relevant for ice.

#### **(b) Intermolecular Forces (Primary Forces in Ice)**
1. **Hydrogen Bonds**:
   - These are the dominant forces in ice, forming a network between water molecules.
   - Hydrogen atoms in one molecule are attracted to oxygen atoms in neighboring molecules.
   - Responsible for the hexagonal crystal lattice of ice.
   - Lower temperatures strengthen hydrogen bonds by reducing thermal vibrations, making the lattice more rigid.

2. **Van der Waals Forces**:
   - Weak, distance-dependent attractions between molecules.
   - Contribute minimally to the structure of ice but become slightly stronger as molecules move closer at lower temperatures.

---

### **2. How Lower Temperatures Affect These Forces**
- **Nuclear Forces**:
  - The protons and neutrons in oxygen and hydrogen nuclei remain unaffected. Their binding energy is orders of magnitude stronger than the thermal energies involved in cooling ice.

- **Hydrogen Bonds**:
  - Thermal motion decreases as temperature drops, allowing hydrogen bonds to stabilize and maintain a more rigid crystal lattice.
  - Lowering the temperature reduces the likelihood of bond breaking due to thermal energy.

- **Lattice Stability**:
  - As ice cools, the crystal lattice contracts slightly and becomes more tightly packed due to reduced molecular vibrations.

---

### **3. Observable Changes in Ice**
1. **Strength and Brittleness**:
   - As hydrogen bonds become more rigid, the ice becomes stronger but more brittle.

2. **Thermal Conductivity**:
   - Cooler ice has reduced molecular motion, enhancing its ability to conduct heat.

3. **Density**:
   - The lattice shrinks slightly, increasing density, but it remains less dense than liquid water.

---

### **4. Why Nuclear Forces Don’t Change**
The forces that govern the atomic nucleus (protons and neutrons) are several orders of magnitude stronger than intermolecular forces:
- **Strong Nuclear Force Energy Scale**:
  - Binding energy in the nucleus: \( \sim 1 \, \text{MeV}\) per nucleon.
- **Hydrogen Bond Energy Scale**:
  - Energy of a single hydrogen bond: \( \sim 0.2 \, \text{eV}\).

The temperatures involved in cooling ice (down to cryogenic levels) are far too low to influence nuclear interactions.

---

### **5. Summary**
- Lowering the temperature of ice strengthens **hydrogen bonds** and slightly increases the rigidity and density of the crystal lattice.
- **Nuclear forces** (strong and weak) remain entirely unaffected because they operate at a much smaller scale and are far stronger than the forces governing molecular behavior in ice.
- The observable changes in ice are entirely due to changes in **intermolecular forces**, not nuclear ones.
