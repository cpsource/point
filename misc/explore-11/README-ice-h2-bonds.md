**Hydrogen bonds** are a key feature of water and ice, and they do change with temperature, primarily because temperature affects the **thermal motion** of molecules and the ability of hydrogen bonds to form and remain stable. Here’s a detailed explanation:

---

### **1. What Are Hydrogen Bonds?**
- **Definition**:
  - A hydrogen bond is a type of intermolecular force that occurs when a hydrogen atom covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom (like oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine) interacts with a lone pair of electrons on a nearby electronegative atom.

- **In Ice**:
  - Hydrogen bonds connect water molecules in a hexagonal lattice structure.
  - Each water molecule forms hydrogen bonds with four neighbors, creating a rigid and open lattice.

---

### **2. How Are Hydrogen Bonds Affected by Temperature?**
Temperature changes affect hydrogen bonds because thermal energy competes with the energy stabilizing the bonds.

#### **(a) At Higher Temperatures**
1. **Increased Thermal Motion**:
   - As temperature rises, water molecules vibrate and move more rapidly.
   - This motion disrupts hydrogen bonds, making them weaker and less stable.

2. **Bond Breaking**:
   - Higher thermal energy allows more hydrogen bonds to break at any given moment, reducing the average number of bonds per molecule.

3. **Transition to Liquid Water**:
   - When ice melts, hydrogen bonds are partially broken, and the water molecules become more mobile while still maintaining transient hydrogen bonds.

---

#### **(b) At Lower Temperatures**
1. **Reduced Thermal Motion**:
   - Cooling reduces molecular vibrations, allowing hydrogen bonds to stabilize and persist longer.
   - The ice lattice becomes more rigid and ordered as the temperature drops.

2. **Increased Bond Strength**:
   - Hydrogen bonds become slightly stronger at lower temperatures because the reduced motion decreases bond-breaking events.

3. **Changes in the Ice Lattice**:
   - As temperature decreases, the hexagonal lattice contracts slightly, bringing molecules closer together and strengthening the hydrogen bond network.

---

### **3. Why Do Hydrogen Bonds Change With Temperature?**
#### **(a) Competing Energies**
- The stability of hydrogen bonds depends on the balance between:
  - **Bonding Energy**:
    - Hydrogen bonds have an average energy of \( \sim 0.2 \, \text{eV} \) per bond, enough to stabilize the lattice under normal conditions.
  - **Thermal Energy**:
    - Thermal energy increases with temperature and competes with the bonding energy, disrupting bonds as it increases.

#### **(b) Quantum and Vibrational Effects**
- Hydrogen bonds also exhibit quantum mechanical behavior:
  - At higher temperatures, the vibrational energy levels of the molecules increase, leading to more frequent bond breaking.
  - At lower temperatures, vibrational levels are reduced, favoring stable bonds.

---

### **4. Observable Effects of Temperature on Hydrogen Bonds**
1. **Melting and Freezing**:
   - Melting: As temperature rises to \( 0^\circ \text{C} \), hydrogen bonds break, and the ice lattice collapses into liquid water.
   - Freezing: As temperature drops, hydrogen bonds re-form and organize into the stable hexagonal lattice of Ice Ih.

2. **Strength of Ice**:
   - As ice cools below \( 0^\circ \text{C} \), hydrogen bonds become more stable and rigid, making ice stronger but more brittle.

3. **Density Changes**:
   - The open hexagonal lattice of ice makes it less dense than liquid water. As ice cools further, the lattice contracts slightly, but the hydrogen bond network remains intact.

---

### **5. Summary**
- **Hydrogen bonds are affected by temperature because thermal energy competes with the energy stabilizing these bonds.**
  - At higher temperatures: Increased motion weakens and breaks hydrogen bonds.
  - At lower temperatures: Reduced motion strengthens and stabilizes hydrogen bonds.
- In ice, hydrogen bonds maintain the hexagonal lattice but become more rigid and slightly stronger as the temperature decreases.
