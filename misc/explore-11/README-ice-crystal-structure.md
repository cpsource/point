The **crystal lattice structure of ice** does not fundamentally change as it gets colder under normal atmospheric pressure; it remains the familiar **hexagonal structure** known as **Ice Ih** (Ice One-H). However, there are subtle changes in the lattice due to reduced thermal motion, and under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, ice can adopt different crystal structures (phases).

Here’s how the lattice responds to cooling:

---

### **1. Ice Ih at Lower Temperatures**
#### (a) **Hexagonal Crystal Structure**
- At standard atmospheric pressure, water freezes into the **Ice Ih** form, a hexagonal lattice where:
  - Each oxygen atom is surrounded by four others in a tetrahedral arrangement.
  - Hydrogen bonds hold the lattice together, with oxygen atoms at the vertices.

#### (b) **Effects of Cooling**
1. **Reduced Molecular Vibrations**:
   - As the temperature drops, the thermal vibrations of the water molecules within the lattice decrease.
   - This leads to a more rigid and stable lattice.

2. **Lattice Contraction**:
   - The reduced vibrations cause the lattice to shrink slightly as the molecules move closer together.
   - This results in a small increase in density, although ice remains less dense than liquid water due to the open, tetrahedral nature of the lattice.

### **2. Does the Lattice Structure Change?**
Under normal atmospheric pressure, the lattice structure of Ice Ih does not change as the temperature decreases—it simply becomes more compact.

#### **Extreme Conditions**
1. **High Pressure**:
   - At high pressures, ice can transition to different crystalline phases, such as:
     - **Ice II**: Denser and more ordered.
     - **Ice III, V, VI, VII, etc.**: Various high-pressure forms with distinct structures.
   - These phases have different densities and arrangements of hydrogen bonds.

2. **Low Temperature with Pressure**:
   - In cryogenic conditions, ice can transition into very dense phases like **Ice XI**, a proton-ordered version of Ice Ih.

### **3. Key Points About Ice Ih as It Gets Colder**
- The basic **hexagonal lattice structure** remains unchanged under normal conditions.
- The lattice becomes more rigid and contracts slightly due to reduced thermal motion.
- Changes in structure occur only under extreme pressures or unusual conditions, not typical cooling.

---

### **4. Practical Implications**
- **Ice Strength and Brittleness**:
  - Cooling strengthens the lattice, making ice more brittle at lower temperatures.
- **Optical Properties**:
  - The reduced molecular vibrations may also make the ice slightly more transparent to light.

---

### **5. Summary**
- The crystal lattice structure of Ice Ih (hexagonal ice) remains the same as it cools under normal atmospheric pressure.
- The lattice contracts slightly due to reduced thermal motion but does not change fundamentally unless subjected to extreme pressures.
