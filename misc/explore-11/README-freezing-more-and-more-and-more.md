When cooling ice **releases energy**, the water particles get **closer together** due to reduced kinetic energy, but **the atomic bonds within the water molecules themselves do not change**. Instead, the changes primarily involve the arrangement and behavior of the water molecules, not the individual atomic bonds.

### **1. Molecular Behavior in Cooling Ice**
#### (a) **Kinetic Energy Decreases**
- As ice cools, the molecules lose kinetic energy, meaning they vibrate less around their fixed positions in the crystal lattice.
- Lower kinetic energy allows the water molecules to pack slightly closer together.

#### (b) **Crystal Lattice Stays Intact**
- In solid ice, water molecules are arranged in a hexagonal crystal lattice held together by **hydrogen bonds**.
- As the temperature drops, the structure of the lattice remains essentially the same, but the thermal vibrations of the molecules are reduced.

### **2. Do Atomic Bonds Change?**
#### **Within the Water Molecule:**
- The **covalent bonds** between hydrogen and oxygen atoms in the water molecules are extremely strong.
- These bonds are unaffected by cooling and remain intact.

#### **Between Water Molecules:**
- The **hydrogen bonds** between water molecules, which hold the ice lattice together, become slightly stronger as the temperature drops because lower thermal motion reduces bond-breaking events.

### **3. Do Water Molecules Get Closer Together?**
Yes, to a small extent:
- As the temperature decreases, the reduced thermal vibrations allow the molecules to move slightly closer together.
- However, the unique structure of ice (hexagonal lattice) is already less dense than liquid water due to the way hydrogen bonds organize the molecules. This is why ice floats on water.

---

### **4. Summary**
- Cooling ice releases energy because the water molecules lose kinetic energy and vibrate less.
- The molecules can get slightly closer together, but the overall crystal lattice structure remains intact.
- The covalent bonds within the water molecules remain unchanged; the only changes involve intermolecular hydrogen bonding and reduced vibrational energy.
