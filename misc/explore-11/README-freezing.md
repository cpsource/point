**Freezing releases energy.** 

When a liquid transitions to a solid, the particles lose kinetic energy, and the process releases heat to the surroundings. Here's why:

---

### **1. Freezing as an Exothermic Process**
- In a liquid, particles are loosely held together and move more freely, which requires more energy to maintain than a solid structure.
- During freezing:
  1. Particles slow down as the temperature drops.
  2. Intermolecular forces pull particles into a more ordered, rigid arrangement (the solid phase).
  3. The energy no longer needed to maintain the more disordered liquid state is **released** as heat.

---

### **2. Where Does the Released Energy Go?**
The energy released during freezing is called the **latent heat of fusion**. It is:
- Transferred to the surroundings, warming them.
- Necessary for maintaining the equilibrium during the phase change.

---

### **3. Example: Freezing Water**
- For water, the latent heat of fusion is approximately **334 J/g**.
- This means that for every gram of water that freezes at \(0^\circ \, \text{C}\), \(334 \, \text{J}\) of heat is released to the environment.

---

### **4. Why Does Freezing Release Energy?**
Freezing releases energy because the system moves to a **more stable, lower-energy state**:
- A solid is more ordered and has lower internal energy than a liquid.
- The energy difference between the liquid and solid states is released to the surroundings.

---

### **5. Everyday Observations**
- When water freezes in a freezer, the heat released by the freezing water warms the air inside the freezer.
- The freezerâ€™s cooling system then works to remove this heat.

---

### **6. Summary**
- Freezing is an **exothermic process**.
- Heat is released as the liquid transitions to a solid.
- This energy transfer is why freezing warms the surroundings while cooling the substance being frozen.
