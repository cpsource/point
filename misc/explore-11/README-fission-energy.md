Energy is released during **fission** because the resulting nuclei (fission fragments) are **more stable** than the original heavy nucleus. This increased stability corresponds to a **lower total energy** in the fission fragments compared to the original nucleus, and the difference in energy is released.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

---

### **1. Key Concept: Binding Energy Per Nucleon**
- **Binding energy** is the energy required to separate a nucleus into its individual protons and neutrons.
- **Binding energy per nucleon** indicates how tightly each nucleon (proton or neutron) is bound in a nucleus.
- **Lighter nuclei (up to iron)**:
  - High binding energy per nucleon, meaning they are very stable.
- **Heavier nuclei (beyond iron)**:
  - Lower binding energy per nucleon, meaning they are less stable.

In fission, a heavy nucleus splits into smaller nuclei that have a higher binding energy per nucleon, releasing the excess energy.

---

### **2. Fission Energy Release Explained**
#### **(a) Initial Heavy Nucleus**
- Heavy nuclei like uranium-235 (\( \text{U}^{235} \)) or plutonium-239 (\( \text{Pu}^{239} \)) have relatively low binding energy per nucleon (around \(7.6 \, \text{MeV}\)).
- These nuclei are less stable because the strong nuclear force struggles to hold together so many protons, which repel each other due to their positive charges.

#### **(b) Fission Products**
- When a heavy nucleus undergoes fission, it splits into two smaller nuclei (fission fragments), such as barium (\( \text{Ba} \)) and krypton (\( \text{Kr} \)).
- These smaller nuclei have a **higher binding energy per nucleon** (around \(8.5 \, \text{MeV}\)), meaning they are more stable.

#### **(c) Energy Released**
- The difference in binding energy between the original nucleus and the fission fragments is released:
  \[
  E_{\text{released}} = \text{(Binding energy of fission products)} - \text{(Binding energy of original nucleus)}.
  \]

### **3. Where Does the Released Energy Go?**
The energy released during fission appears in several forms:
1. **Kinetic Energy of Fission Fragments**:
   - The fission fragments (smaller nuclei) fly apart due to Coulomb repulsion, carrying most of the released energy as kinetic energy.

2. **Neutrons**:
   - Free neutrons are emitted during fission, carrying kinetic energy.

3. **Radiation**:
   - Gamma rays and beta particles are emitted during or after fission.

4. **Heat**:
   - The kinetic energy of fission fragments and neutrons is converted into heat when they collide with surrounding material (e.g., in a nuclear reactor).

### **4. Quantifying Fission Energy**
#### **(a) Example: Fission of Uranium-235**
1. **Energy Released**:
   - Typical fission products are barium-141 (\( \text{Ba}^{141} \)) and krypton-92 (\( \text{Kr}^{92} \)).
   - The total binding energy per nucleon increases after fission:
     - Uranium-235: \( \sim 7.6 \, \text{MeV/nucleon} \)
     - Fission products: \( \sim 8.5 \, \text{MeV/nucleon} \)
   - Energy released:
     \[
     \Delta E \approx (8.5 - 7.6) \, \text{MeV/nucleon} \times 235 \, \text{nucleons} \approx 200 \, \text{MeV}.
     \]

2. **Energy Distribution**:
   - Kinetic energy of fission fragments: \( \sim 170 \, \text{MeV} \)
   - Kinetic energy of neutrons: \( \sim 5 \, \text{MeV} \)
   - Gamma radiation: \( \sim 10 \, \text{MeV} \)
   - Beta particles and other decay products: \( \sim 15 \, \text{MeV} \)

### **5. Why Are Heavy Nuclei Less Stable?**
#### **(a) Coulomb Repulsion**
- Protons in the nucleus repel each other due to their positive charge.
- In heavy nuclei, this repulsion becomes significant because of the large number of protons.

#### **(b) Surface-to-Volume Ratio**
- The strong nuclear force binds nucleons together but acts only over short distances.
- In large nuclei, nucleons near the surface are less tightly bound, reducing overall stability.

#### **(c) Fission as a Path to Stability**
- By splitting into smaller nuclei, the system achieves a more stable configuration with a higher binding energy per nucleon, releasing the excess energy.

---

### **6. Summary**
- Fission releases energy because the resulting nuclei are more stable, with higher binding energy per nucleon.
- The released energy corresponds to the difference in total binding energy between the initial heavy nucleus and the fission fragments.
- This energy appears as kinetic energy, radiation, and heat, which powers nuclear reactors and explosions.
