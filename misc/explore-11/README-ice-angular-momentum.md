Freezing water in a **spinning disc** can preserve the **angular momentum** of the system, but the way angular momentum is distributed and manifests depends on the state of the water before and during freezing. Here's what happens:

---

### **1. Conservation of Angular Momentum**
- Angular momentum is a conserved quantity, meaning that the **total angular momentum of the system remains constant** as long as no external torques are applied.
- For a spinning disc of water:
  - Before freezing: The angular momentum is distributed within the rotating liquid water.
  - After freezing: The angular momentum is transferred to the solid ice that forms.

#### **(a) Uniform Disc**
- If the disc is spinning uniformly and water freezes uniformly, the angular momentum of the system remains the same and is preserved in the solid ice.

#### **(b) Uneven Freezing**
- If the water freezes unevenly (e.g., crystallization starts at the edges or center), the redistribution of mass may alter the rotational dynamics, but the **total angular momentum** remains constant.

---

### **2. Distribution of Angular Momentum**
The angular momentum (\(L\)) of a spinning disc depends on its **moment of inertia** (\(I\)) and **angular velocity** (\(\omega\)):
\[
L = I \cdot \omega
\]
Where:
- \(I\): Moment of inertia, which depends on the mass distribution.
- \(\omega\): Angular velocity of the spinning disc.

#### **(a) Changes in Moment of Inertia During Freezing**
- As the water freezes, the mass redistributes slightly due to:
  - Density differences between water and ice.
  - Changes in the internal structure of the system.
- The moment of inertia may change, but the angular momentum is conserved, so the angular velocity (\(\omega\)) must adjust inversely:
  - \(I_{\text{frozen}} \cdot \omega_{\text{frozen}} = I_{\text{liquid}} \cdot \omega_{\text{liquid}}\).

#### **(b) Practical Effects**
- If freezing occurs symmetrically, \(I\) changes uniformly, and the entire system spins slightly faster or slower to conserve angular momentum.
- If freezing is asymmetric, uneven mass distribution could cause **wobbling** or **precession** of the disc.

### **3. What Happens to Internal Water Molecule Motion?**
1. **Molecular Rotation and Vibration**:
   - Before freezing: Water molecules have individual rotational and vibrational motions.
   - After freezing: These motions are constrained by the rigid crystal lattice, but the bulk rotation of the system persists.

2. **Hydrogen Bond Network**:
   - The freezing process locks molecules into a hexagonal lattice, preserving the bulk angular momentum but restricting individual molecular motion.

---

### **4. Detecting Changes**
You can detect differences between a spinning disc frozen in motion versus one frozen while stationary by observing:

#### **(a) Angular Velocity**
- Measure the spin rate (\(\omega\)) before and after freezing. Changes in spin rate reflect changes in the moment of inertia due to freezing.

#### **(b) Wobbling or Precession**
- If freezing is uneven, the mass distribution may become asymmetric, causing the disc to wobble or precess as it spins.

#### **(c) Structural Stress**
- Freezing while spinning may induce stresses in the ice lattice, potentially leading to cracking or anisotropic mechanical properties.

### **5. Applications and Analogies**
Freezing water in a spinning disc is analogous to:
- **Planetary Ice Formation**:
  - On spinning celestial bodies, freezing water or ice layers distribute angular momentum across the planetâ€™s surface.
- **Rotating Machinery**:
  - In cryogenics or industrial processes, freezing liquids in motion requires careful control to avoid structural instabilities.

---

### **6. Summary**
- The **angular momentum of the spinning disc is conserved** during freezing as long as no external torques act on the system.
- The moment of inertia may change due to mass redistribution, causing the spin rate (\(\omega\)) to adjust inversely.
- Asymmetric freezing could lead to wobbling or precession due to uneven mass distribution.
