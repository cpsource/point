The formation of water (\( \text{H}_2 + \frac{1}{2} \text{O}_2 \to \text{H}_2\text{O} \)) involves breaking the bonds in \( \text{H}_2 \) and \( \text{O}_2 \) and forming new bonds in \( \text{H}_2\text{O} \). This reaction releases energy because the bonds in water are stronger than those in the reactants. Let's break down the energy analysis:

---

### **1. Energy Analysis Components**

#### **(a) Energy of Reactants**
1. **Hydrogen Molecule (\( \text{H}_2 \))**:
   - Bond energy (dissociation energy): \( 4.478 \, \text{eV} \).
   - The energy required to break the bond in one \( \text{H}_2 \) molecule is \( 4.478 \, \text{eV} \).

2. **Oxygen Molecule (\( \text{O}_2 \))**:
   - Bond energy (dissociation energy): \( 5.117 \, \text{eV} \).
   - Since only half an \( \text{O}_2 \) molecule reacts, the energy required to break the bond is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 5.117 = 2.5585 \, \text{eV}.
     \]

#### Total Energy to Break Reactant Bonds:
\[
E_{\text{break}} = 4.478 \, \text{eV} + 2.5585 \, \text{eV} = 7.0365 \, \text{eV}.
\]

---

#### **(b) Energy of Products**
1. **Water Molecule (\( \text{H}_2\text{O} \))**:
   - Water has two \( \text{O-H} \) bonds, each with a bond energy of \( 5.1 \, \text{eV} \) (on average).
   - The total energy released in forming these bonds is:
     \[
     E_{\text{form}} = 2 \times 5.1 = 10.2 \, \text{eV}.
     \]

---

#### **(c) Net Energy Released**
The net energy released during the reaction is the difference between the energy required to break the reactants' bonds and the energy released when the product bonds form:
\[
E_{\text{net}} = E_{\text{form}} - E_{\text{break}} = 10.2 \, \text{eV} - 7.0365 \, \text{eV} = 3.1635 \, \text{eV}.
\]

This energy is released as heat or light during the reaction.

---

### **2. Remaining Energy in \( \text{H}_2\text{O} \)**
The total energy of the \( \text{H}_2\text{O} \) molecule includes:
1. **Rest Energy**:
   - Protons and neutrons in the nuclei contribute:
     \[
     E_{\text{rest (nuclei)}} = 2 \times (938.272 + 939.565) + 8 \times 0.511 \, \text{MeV} \approx 18,014.6 \, \text{MeV}.
     \]

2. **Binding Energy**:
   - The electronic energy of \( \text{H}_2\text{O} \), which includes the bonding of the electrons:
     \[
     E_{\text{electronic}} \approx -75.6 \, \text{eV} = -0.0756 \, \text{MeV}.
     \]

3. **Rotational and Vibrational Energy**:
   - In the ground state, these are small but contribute a few \( \text{meV} \) or less at room temperature.

---

### **3. Summary of Energies**
1. **Reactants**:
   - Energy to break bonds in \( \text{H}_2 \) and \( \text{O}_2 \): \( 7.0365 \, \text{eV} \).

2. **Products**:
   - Energy released in forming \( \text{H}_2\text{O} \) bonds: \( 10.2 \, \text{eV} \).

3. **Net Released Energy**:
   \[
   E_{\text{released}} = 3.1635 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

4. **Remaining Energy in \( \text{H}_2\text{O} \)**:
   - Dominated by the rest energy of its protons and neutrons, \( \sim 18,014.6 \, \text{MeV} \), with small contributions from electronic, rotational, and vibrational energies.

---

### **4. Observations**
- The energy released during the reaction is much smaller than the total energy in the \( \text{H}_2\text{O} \) molecule because the rest energy of the particles dominates.
- The heat or light observed during the reaction (\( 3.1635 \, \text{eV} \)) corresponds to the difference in bond energies, not the total energy.
