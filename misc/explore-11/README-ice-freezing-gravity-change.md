No, the **gravity of the ice** would not be affected by freezing it in an electrostatic field or magnetic field. Gravity depends solely on the **mass** of the ice, and the mass remains unchanged regardless of how the ice is formed. Here’s a detailed explanation:

---

### **1. Why Gravity Remains Unchanged**

#### **(a) Gravity and Mass**
- The gravitational force a body exerts is proportional to its mass, as given by Newton's law of gravitation:
  \[
  F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2},
  \]
  where:
  - \(m_1, m_2\) are the masses of the two bodies.
  - \(G\) is the gravitational constant.
  - \(r\) is the distance between their centers.

- Freezing water in an electrostatic field or magnetic field does not change the total mass of the ice (the combined mass of its protons, neutrons, and electrons).

---

#### **(b) Effects of Molecular Alignment**
- **Electrostatic or magnetic alignment** might influence the arrangement of molecules or dipoles within the ice but does not alter the intrinsic mass of the system.
- Changes in the orientation or distribution of dipoles do not contribute to gravitational effects, as gravity arises from mass, not electromagnetic interactions.

---

### **2. Hypothetical Situations Where Gravity Could Change**

#### **(a) Mass Loss or Gain**
- If freezing caused a change in mass (e.g., by releasing molecules or trapping additional matter), the gravitational force could change. However:
  - Ice does not lose or gain mass when frozen in a field—it only undergoes structural reorganization.

#### **(b) Energy Contribution**
- In extreme scenarios (e.g., nuclear reactions), the release of binding energy could reduce the system's effective mass via \(E = mc^2\).
- Freezing water involves much smaller energy changes (thermal energy) that are negligible compared to the mass of the system.

---

### **3. What Does Change?**
While gravity remains constant, some other properties of the ice could be affected:
1. **Magnetic or Electric Field Effects**:
   - Frozen dipoles might produce residual polarization, affecting how the ice interacts with electromagnetic fields.
2. **Mechanical or Optical Properties**:
   - Changes in molecular alignment could alter the ice’s strength, transparency, or birefringence.

---

### **4. Summary**
- The gravitational force of the ice is determined by its mass, which remains unchanged regardless of how the ice is frozen.
- Neither electrostatic nor magnetic fields directly influence gravity.
- The effects of these fields are limited to molecular or electromagnetic properties, not gravitational ones.
