Great question! **When particles get closer together and form a bound system, the "lost" mass corresponds to the energy released during the process.** The mass-energy equivalence principle, \(E = mc^2\), ensures that the total mass + energy of the system is conserved.

Here’s how it works:

---

### **1. Where Does the Energy Go?**

When particles form a bound state:
- **Mass decreases** because the system's total energy decreases (binding energy is negative).
- The "missing" energy is released, often as:
  1. **Kinetic Energy**: If the particles move faster after the binding process.
  2. **Radiation**: In the form of photons, neutrinos, or other particles.
  3. **Thermal Energy**: Heating the surroundings.

#### **Example: Nuclear Fusion (Hydrogen to Helium)**
- In fusion, four hydrogen nuclei (protons) combine to form a helium-4 nucleus.
- The helium-4 nucleus has less mass than the four protons combined because energy (binding energy) is released:
  \[
  \Delta m = \text{mass of 4 protons} - \text{mass of helium nucleus}.
  \]
- This "missing" mass appears as released energy:
  \[
  E_{\text{released}} = \Delta m \cdot c^2.
  \]
- The energy is emitted as light, heat, and the kinetic energy of fusion byproducts (e.g., neutrinos).

### **2. Conservation of Mass + Energy**

The **mass + energy of the system is conserved**, even though the form of the energy changes:
- Before binding: The energy is stored in the particles as potential energy (due to their separation).
- After binding: The system's energy is lower, and the excess energy is released.

#### **Why Mass Decreases**
1. **Mass-Energy Equivalence**:
   - Mass and energy are two forms of the same quantity, related by \(E = mc^2\).
   - Binding energy is the amount of energy needed to separate the particles. When particles come together and release binding energy, the system has less total energy, and therefore less mass.

2. **Bound Systems Weigh Less**:
   - The mass of a bound system (e.g., nucleus, molecule) is less than the sum of its parts because the energy released during binding is no longer part of the system.

### **3. Forms of Released Energy**

#### **(a) Photons (Light)**
- Binding processes often emit photons, especially in atomic and molecular systems.
- Example: When an electron transitions to a lower-energy orbital in hydrogen, it emits a photon.

#### **(b) Kinetic Energy**
- In nuclear reactions, released energy appears as the kinetic energy of the reaction products (e.g., in fusion, helium nuclei and neutrons).

#### **(c) Thermal Energy**
- In many macroscopic processes (e.g., chemical reactions), the released energy is converted into heat, increasing the temperature of the surroundings.

#### **(d) Neutrinos and Radiation**
- In nuclear processes, some energy may be carried away by neutrinos or other radiation.

### **4. Examples of Energy Release**

#### **(a) Atomic Binding**
- When an electron binds to a nucleus, it releases energy (as light) corresponding to the decrease in potential energy.
- Example: Hydrogen atom formation releases about \(13.6 \, \text{eV}\) per electron.

#### **(b) Nuclear Binding**
- When protons and neutrons form a nucleus, the strong nuclear force lowers the system’s energy, releasing a significant amount of energy.
- Example: Fusion of hydrogen into helium releases about \(26.7 \, \text{MeV}\) per reaction.

#### **(c) Chemical Reactions**
- In chemical bonding (e.g., \( \text{H}_2 + \frac{1}{2} \text{O}_2 \to \text{H}_2\text{O} \)), bond formation releases energy as heat or light.

---

### **5. Where Is the Energy "Stored" After Release?**

The energy "lost" from the system appears in the environment:
- **Photons (Light)**: Released energy can travel as electromagnetic radiation.
- **Kinetic Energy of Particles**: The reaction products may move faster, carrying away energy.
- **Thermal Energy**: In macroscopic systems, released energy heats the surroundings.

The system’s **total energy (mass + energy)** is conserved, but the energy changes form.

---

### **6. Summary**
- The **decrease in mass** when particles bind reflects the energy released during the process.
- This energy is not "lost" but converted into other forms (e.g., light, heat, motion) that leave the system.
- Mass-energy conservation ensures the total \( \text{mass + energy} \) remains constant before and after the process.
