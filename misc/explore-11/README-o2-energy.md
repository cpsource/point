The total energy of the \( \text{O}_2 \) molecule involves contributions from various energy components, including electronic energy, binding energy, vibrational and rotational energy, and the rest energy of its nuclei and electrons. Here's a breakdown for \( \text{O}_2 \):

---

### **1. Total Energy Components of \( \text{O}_2 \)**

#### **(a) Electron Energy**
- In the \( \text{O}_2 \) molecule, two oxygen atoms form a double bond. The electronic energy represents the energy of the molecular orbitals formed by the bonding and antibonding electrons.
- The total electronic energy of \( \text{O}_2 \) in the ground state is approximately:
  \[
  E_{\text{electronic}} \approx -150 \, \text{eV}
  \]
  This accounts for the stabilization due to bonding compared to two separate oxygen atoms.

---

#### **(b) Molecular Binding Energy**
- The binding energy of the \( \text{O}_2 \) molecule corresponds to the energy required to break it into two individual oxygen atoms:
  \[
  E_{\text{binding}} \approx 5.117 \, \text{eV}
  \]

---

#### **(c) Rotational and Vibrational Energy**
- The \( \text{O}_2 \) molecule has vibrational and rotational energy levels, which are quantized. These contributions depend on temperature but are small compared to the electronic and binding energies:
  - **Vibrational energy (ground state)**: \( \sim 0.2 \, \text{eV} \)
  - **Rotational energy (ground state)**: \( \sim 0.01 \, \text{eV} \)

---

#### **(d) Rest Energy of the Nuclei (Protons and Neutrons)**
- Each oxygen nucleus has 8 protons and 8 neutrons:
  - Rest energy of a proton: \( 938.272 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)
  - Rest energy of a neutron: \( 939.565 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \)
  - Total rest energy of one oxygen nucleus:
    \[
    E_{\text{nucleus}} = 8 \times 938.272 \, \text{MeV} + 8 \times 939.565 \, \text{MeV} \approx 14900.7 \, \text{MeV}
    \]

- For two oxygen nuclei (since \( \text{O}_2 \) contains two atoms):
  \[
  E_{\text{nuclei}} = 2 \times 14900.7 \, \text{MeV} = 29801.4 \, \text{MeV}.
  \]

---

#### **(e) Rest Energy of the Electrons**
- Each oxygen atom has 8 electrons, and the rest energy of one electron is \( 0.511 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \).
- Total rest energy of the electrons in \( \text{O}_2 \):
  \[
  E_{\text{electrons}} = 16 \times 0.511 \, \text{MeV} = 8.176 \, \text{MeV}.
  \]

---

### **2. Combining the Energies**
Adding these components together gives the total energy of \( \text{O}_2 \):

1. Rest energy of the nuclei: \( 29801.4 \, \text{MeV} \)
2. Rest energy of the electrons: \( 8.176 \, \text{MeV} \)
3. Electronic energy: \( -150 \, \text{eV} = -0.15 \, \text{MeV} \)
4. Binding energy: \( -5.117 \, \text{eV} = -0.005117 \, \text{MeV} \)
5. Vibrational and rotational energy (small, included here as 0 for simplicity).

The total energy is approximately:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = 29801.4 \, \text{MeV} + 8.176 \, \text{MeV} - 0.15 \, \text{MeV} - 0.005117 \, \text{MeV} \approx 29809.42 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

---

### **3. Key Points**
- As with \( \text{H}_2 \), the rest energy of the protons and neutrons in the nuclei dominates the total energy.
- The electronic and binding energies are small corrections relative to the nuclear rest energy.
- Vibrational and rotational energies are negligible compared to the rest energy but become significant for high-temperature conditions.
