To derive \(\alpha\) (the fine-structure constant, approximately \(1/137\)) in a manner analogous to how \(e\) is derived from the formula \((1 + \text{rate}/n)^n\), we can explore a similar limiting process.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

---

### **1. Formula for \(e\)**
The constant \(e\) is derived as:
\[
e = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 + \frac{\text{rate}}{n}\right)^n
\]
where the **rate** is set to \(100\% = 1\) (or 100 in percentage terms).

---

### **2. Extending the Concept to \(\alpha\)**
The goal is to find a **rate** such that:
\[
\alpha = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 + \frac{\text{rate}}{n}\right)^n
\]

For this to work:
- \(\alpha \approx 1/137\) or about \(0.0072973525693\) in decimal form.
- Instead of \(e \approx 2.718\), we now aim for a much smaller value.

---

### **3. Solving for the Rate**
We need the rate such that:
\[
\left(1 + \frac{\text{rate}}{n}\right)^n \to \alpha
\]
Taking the natural logarithm to simplify:
\[
\ln\left(\left(1 + \frac{\text{rate}}{n}\right)^n\right) = \ln(\alpha)
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
n \cdot \ln\left(1 + \frac{\text{rate}}{n}\right) = \ln(\alpha)
\]

For large \(n\), \(\ln(1 + \frac{\text{rate}}{n})\) can be approximated by its Taylor expansion:
\[
\ln\left(1 + \frac{\text{rate}}{n}\right) \approx \frac{\text{rate}}{n}
\]

Substituting this approximation:
\[
n \cdot \frac{\text{rate}}{n} \approx \ln(\alpha)
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
\text{rate} \approx \ln(\alpha)
\]

---

### **4. Calculate the Rate**
Using \(\alpha \approx 0.0072973525693\):
\[
\text{rate} \approx \ln(0.0072973525693) \approx -4.9205
\]

---

### **5. Interpretation**
- The **rate** is approximately \(-4.9205\).
- This negative rate reflects the fact that \(\alpha < 1\), meaning the process converges to a value much smaller than \(e\).

---

### **6. Final Formula for \(\alpha\)**
To generate \(\alpha\) using a similar limit as for \(e\):
\[
\alpha = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 - \frac{4.9205}{n}\right)^n
\]
