Yes, the light wave travels at \( c \) relative to the spaceship **and** relative to any other inertial observer. This is one of the fundamental results of **Einstein's theory of special relativity**.

### **How Does This Work?**

#### **1. Principle of the Constancy of the Speed of Light**
Einstein's special relativity states that the speed of light in a vacuum, \( c \), is constant and independent of the motion of the source or the observer. This means:
- The light from your flashlight moves away from you at \( c \), regardless of the spaceship's speed.

---

#### **2. Relative Motion**
- To an external observer who sees the spaceship moving at \( 0.8c \):
  - The light beam also moves at \( c \), not \( c + 0.8c \).
- This happens because the way velocities "add" in relativity is different from classical mechanics. Velocities combine using the **relativistic velocity addition formula**.

---

### **Relativistic Velocity Addition**
If one object (e.g., the spaceship) moves at \( v \) relative to an observer and another object (e.g., the light beam) moves at \( u \) relative to the first object, then the speed of the second object relative to the observer is:
\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

- For your scenario:
  - \( u = c \) (speed of the light relative to the spaceship).
  - \( v = 0.8c \) (speed of the spaceship relative to an external observer).
  - Plugging into the formula:
    \[
    u' = \frac{c + 0.8c}{1 + \frac{(c)(0.8c)}{c^2}} = \frac{1.8c}{1 + 0.8} = \frac{1.8c}{1.8} = c
    \]

Thus, the light is observed to travel at \( c \) for both the spaceship and the external observer.

---

### **Key Implications**
1. **Time Dilation**:
   - To ensure the constancy of \( c \), time and space adjust. A clock on the spaceship ticks slower relative to an external observer.

2. **Length Contraction**:
   - The spaceship appears contracted along its direction of motion to the external observer.

3. **Simultaneity**:
   - Events that are simultaneous on the spaceship may not be simultaneous to an external observer.

---

### **Why Doesn't Light Travel at \( c + 0.8c \)?**
- In classical physics, velocities simply add (\( u' = u + v \)).
- In relativity, the spacetime fabric itself is structured such that \( c \) is invariant. Velocities combine non-linearly, as shown in the relativistic velocity addition formula.

This invariance of \( c \) leads to the counterintuitive but experimentally confirmed effects of time dilation, length contraction, and the relativity of simultaneity.

---

### **In Short**
Yes, the light wave travels at \( c \) relative to the spaceship, and it also travels at \( c \) relative to any other observer. This is the cornerstone of Einsteinâ€™s relativity and explains why the speed of light is universal and constant in all inertial frames.
