Yes, the person on the spaceship and the external observer would measure **different frequencies** for the light, due to the **Doppler effect** in special relativity. This effect causes the light’s frequency (and wavelength) to appear different depending on the relative motion between the source and the observer.

---

### **1. Frequency Seen by the Spaceship Observer**
- The person on the spaceship is **at rest relative to the flashlight**.
- They would see the light at its emitted frequency (\( f_0 \)), because there is no relative motion between them and the light source.

---

### **2. Frequency Seen by the External Observer**
The external observer, moving at \( 0.8c \) relative to the spaceship, would measure a different frequency due to **relativistic Doppler shift**.

#### **Relativistic Doppler Shift Formula**
The observed frequency (\( f_{\text{obs}} \)) is given by:
\[
f_{\text{obs}} = f_0 \sqrt{\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}}
\]
where:
- \( f_0 \): Emitted frequency of the light.
- \( \beta = v / c \): The relative velocity as a fraction of the speed of light.

#### **Case 1: Spaceship Moving Towards the Observer**
If the spaceship is moving **towards** the observer (\( v = 0.8c \)):
\[
f_{\text{obs}} = f_0 \sqrt{\frac{1 - 0.8}{1 + 0.8}} = f_0 \sqrt{\frac{0.2}{1.8}} = f_0 \sqrt{\frac{1}{9}} = f_0 / 3
\]
- The observer would see a **higher frequency** (blue-shifted).

#### **Case 2: Spaceship Moving Away from the Observer**
If the spaceship is moving **away** from the observer (\( v = -0.8c \)):
\[
f_{\text{obs}} = f_0 \sqrt{\frac{1 + 0.8}{1 - 0.8}} = f_0 \sqrt{\frac{1.8}{0.2}} = f_0 \sqrt{9} = 3f_0
\]
- The observer would see a **lower frequency** (red-shifted).

---

### **3. Example with Specific Values**
Suppose the flashlight emits green light at a frequency of \( f_0 = 5 \times 10^{14} \, \mathrm{Hz} \):
- **Towards the observer**:
  \[
  f_{\text{obs}} = 5 \times 10^{14} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 1.67 \times 10^{14} \, \mathrm{Hz}
  \]
  (Appears as blue-shifted light.)
  
- **Away from the observer**:
  \[
  f_{\text{obs}} = 5 \times 10^{14} \cdot 3 = 15 \times 10^{14} \, \mathrm{Hz}
  \]
  (Appears as red-shifted light.)

---

### **4. Wavelength Perspective**
The frequency shift corresponds to a wavelength shift since:
\[
\lambda = \frac{c}{f}
\]

- A higher observed frequency (\( f_{\text{obs}} > f_0 \)) means a **shorter wavelength** (blue-shift).
- A lower observed frequency (\( f_{\text{obs}} < f_0 \)) means a **longer wavelength** (red-shift).

---

### **5. Summary**
- **Spaceship Guy**: Sees the emitted light at its original frequency (\( f_0 \)), as there’s no relative motion between him and the flashlight.
- **External Observer**: Sees the light frequency shifted due to the relativistic Doppler effect:
  - **Blue-shifted** if the spaceship moves toward them.
  - **Red-shifted** if the spaceship moves away.
