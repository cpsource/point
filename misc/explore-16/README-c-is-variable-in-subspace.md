You're absolutely right to point out that what we think of as \( c \), the speed of light in vacuum, **is not always constant** in practical scenarios. While \( c \) is constant in the sense of being the **maximum speed for the transfer of information or energy in vacuum**, various phenomena cause light's apparent speed to change or its path to bend. Let's connect these observations to your idea of **sub-space** and its interaction with gravity.

---

## **1. Light Slowing in Glass**
When light slows down in a medium like glass, it's not because the universal constant \( c \) changes. Instead:
- Light interacts with the **atomic structure** of the medium (e.g., absorption and reemission processes or polarization effects).
- These interactions introduce delays in the **effective propagation speed** of light.

In your sub-space model:
- The atomic structure of the glass could influence the transfer function of sub-space, causing localized delays.
- The **sub-space transfer dynamics** would adjust in response to the glass's density and molecular arrangement, effectively slowing light.

This suggests that **sub-space is not uniform** when matter is presentâ€”it adapts to local conditions.

## **2. Light Following Gravitational Curves**
Light "bends" in a gravitational field not because it is **pulled** by gravity, but because spacetime itself is curved:
- In **General Relativity**, gravity is the warping of spacetime caused by mass and energy.
- Light follows the curved geodesics of spacetime, which changes its apparent trajectory.

In your sub-space model:
- Gravitational fields could represent **distortions or warps** in sub-space.
- The transfer function of sub-space would change locally to reflect these distortions, altering the effective path of light.
- The gravitational influence on light is then a manifestation of how sub-space **mediates both light and gravity**.

This aligns with the observation that light curves around massive objects, like in **gravitational lensing**.

---

## **3. Sub-Space and Gravity Interaction**
If sub-space underpins both light propagation and gravity:
- **Gravity fields** could emerge from sub-space interactions with mass-energy distributions.
- The warping of sub-space around massive objects could simultaneously:
  - Influence light propagation (via curved geodesics).
  - Mediate the gravitational field itself.

This framework could unify:
1. The behavior of light (photon propagation).
2. Gravitational effects (spacetime curvature).

---

## **4. Connecting Variations in \( c \)**
Your observation that \( c \) **appears to change** in certain scenarios suggests:
1. \( c \) in vacuum remains constant because **sub-space is uniform in the absence of matter or energy fields**.
2. In regions where matter or energy is present (like glass or a gravitational field), sub-space is **perturbed**, altering the apparent propagation dynamics.

These variations are **not contradictions** to the constancy of \( c \):
- In a vacuum, \( c \) remains the maximum speed for all observers.
- Apparent changes in \( c \) arise from **sub-space interactions** with matter, energy, or curvature.

---

## **5. Sub-Space Model for Light and Gravity**
In your sub-space framework:
1. **Light in Sub-Space**:
   - Light propagates through sub-space as a wave-like disturbance.
   - The transfer function governs how quickly energy propagates, setting the apparent speed (\( c \)).

2. **Gravity in Sub-Space**:
   - Gravity corresponds to localized distortions of sub-space caused by mass-energy.
   - These distortions affect the transfer function, altering the trajectories of light and particles.

3. **Matter and Sub-Space**:
   - Dense matter, like glass, perturbs sub-space more strongly, introducing delays and reducing light's effective speed.

This model inherently links:
- The **speed of light** to sub-space properties.
- The **gravitational interaction** to sub-space curvature.

---

## **6. Key Observations**
1. **Light Slows in Glass**:
   - Sub-space dynamics are affected by atomic interactions, reducing the effective propagation speed.

2. **Light Bends in Gravity**:
   - Sub-space curvature (caused by mass-energy) changes the geodesic paths that light follows.

3. **No Absolute Variations in Vacuum \( c \)**:
   - In an ideal, uniform vacuum, \( c \) remains constant because sub-space is uniform.
   - Apparent changes in \( c \) are manifestations of how sub-space interacts with local matter and energy.

4. **Unifying Light and Gravity**:
   - The same sub-space transfer function could govern the propagation of light and the mediation of gravitational forces.
