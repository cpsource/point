This is a great question and gets to the heart of **relativity**: How can you, at some arbitrary observer \( S \) moving with velocity \( v(S) \), determine your own velocity and observe relativistic effects?

---

## **1. Relativity and No Absolute Frame of Reference**
In special relativity:
- There is **no absolute reference frame** (no universal \"rest frame\").
- Motion is **always relative** to another observer or object.

If you're moving at velocity \( v(S) \), you can **only measure your velocity relative to another object or observer**. You **cannot directly observe** your absolute velocity because **absolute motion doesn't exist** in relativity.

---

## **2. Observing Relativistic Effects**
Even though you cannot measure absolute velocity, you can detect **relativistic effects** relative to other observers or signals (like light). These effects include:
1. **Time Dilation**:
   - Clocks moving relative to an observer run slower.
2. **Length Contraction**:
   - Distances along the direction of motion appear shorter.
3. **Relativistic Doppler Shift**:
   - Light or signals emitted from objects moving relative to you appear shifted in frequency (redshift or blueshift).
4. **Aberration of Light**:
   - Light from distant objects appears to change direction due to your motion.

These effects allow you to infer your velocity relative to **other objects**.

---

## **3. Measuring Your Own Velocity (Relative Velocity)**

To determine your velocity \( v(S) \), you need **a reference point**. Here are the steps:

### a) **Reference Object or Observer**
You compare your motion to a known external object, such as:
- **Distant stars** or the **cosmic microwave background (CMB)**.
- A spaceship, planet, or other observer.

By analyzing how fast those objects appear to move relative to you, you can calculate your velocity.

---

### b) **Doppler Shift of Light**
If you emit or receive light from another object, you can observe the **Doppler effect** to determine your speed.

For light, the relativistic Doppler shift is:
\[
f' = f \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}}
\]
- \( f \): Frequency of light emitted by the source.
- \( f' \): Frequency of light you observe.
- \( v \): Relative velocity between you and the source (positive for approaching, negative for receding).
- \( c \): Speed of light.

By measuring the frequency shift, you can solve for your relative velocity \( v \).

---

### c) **Observing Time Dilation**
If you have a synchronized clock on another object (e.g., a planet or spacecraft), you can measure the rate of time passage relative to yours.

The time dilation formula is:
\[
\Delta t' = \gamma \Delta t \quad \text{where} \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}.
\]
- \( \Delta t \): Time interval on the stationary observer.
- \( \Delta t' \): Time interval on your moving clock.

If you observe that a distant clock runs slower than yours, you can infer your relative speed by solving for \( v \).

---

### d) **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Rest Frame**
The **CMB rest frame** is the closest thing we have to a universal reference. The CMB radiation is observed as nearly uniform across the universe.

If you are moving relative to the CMB, you will observe a **Doppler shift**:
- The CMB appears **blueshifted** in the direction of your motion.
- It appears **redshifted** in the opposite direction.

By analyzing this anisotropy (unevenness in temperature and frequency), you can determine your velocity relative to the CMB.

For example, Earth moves at about **370 km/s** relative to the CMB.

---

## **4. Practical Ways to Observe Relativistic Motion**
To observe relativistic effects, you need to:
1. **Compare light signals** (Doppler shift, time of travel).
2. **Compare clocks** (measure time dilation between synchronized clocks).
3. **Observe object lengths** (check for length contraction).
4. **Measure CMB anisotropy** (to approximate your velocity relative to the early universe).

These phenomena allow you to infer your velocity and observe relativistic effects even if there is no universal stationary observer.

---

## **5. Why Donâ€™t You Feel Relativistic Motion?**
If youâ€™re in a spaceship moving at constant velocity \( v \), **you feel no motion**. This is because:
- Inertial reference frames are **equivalent** in relativity.
- You cannot detect motion unless you compare your frame to another frame.

However, once you accelerate (change velocity), you feel forces, and relativistic effects become apparent when interacting with external signals.

---

## **Summary**
1. **No absolute velocity**: Motion is always measured relative to another observer or object.
2. You can infer your relative velocity by:
   - Measuring **Doppler shifts** of light.
   - Observing **time dilation** or **length contraction**.
   - Measuring your motion relative to the **CMB rest frame**.
3. Observing relativistic effects requires external signals or observers to provide a reference.
