The presence of \( c^2 \) in mass measurements, such as "1 eV/\( c^2 \)", comes from Einstein’s famous equation of mass-energy equivalence:

\[
E = mc^2
\]

This equation relates the mass (\( m \)) of an object to its energy (\( E \)), with \( c \), the speed of light in a vacuum (\( \sim 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)), serving as the conversion factor between mass and energy.

### **Why Is \( c^2 \) There?**

1. **Energy Units and Particle Physics**:
   - In particle physics, energy is typically expressed in **electronvolts (eV)** rather than traditional units like joules (\( \text{J} \)).
   - Mass and energy are interchangeable, so instead of using kilograms, particle physicists often express mass in units of energy (eV), divided by \( c^2 \) to account for the equivalence.

2. **Simplifying the Equation**:
   - The energy \( E \) of a particle with mass \( m \) is given by:
     \[
     E = m c^2
     \]
   - Rearranging, the mass is:
     \[
     m = \frac{E}{c^2}
     \]
   - This shows that a mass of \( m \) corresponds to an energy \( E \), and dividing by \( c^2 \) ensures the correct conversion.

### **Practical Example**
For a neutrino with an approximate mass of \( 1 \, \text{eV}/c^2 \):
- **Energy Perspective**:
  - A mass of \( 1 \, \text{eV}/c^2 \) means the neutrino would have an equivalent energy of \( 1 \, \text{eV} \) if converted entirely to energy.
- **Relating to Other Units**:
  - \( 1 \, \text{eV}/c^2 \) is equivalent to \( \sim 1.78 \times 10^{-36} \, \text{kg} \), showing how incredibly light neutrinos are.

---

### **Why Use \( c^2 \) Explicitly?**
Using \( c^2 \) in the unit \( \text{eV}/c^2 \) emphasizes the relationship between mass and energy:
1. **Conceptual**:
   - It reflects that mass isn’t an independent property; it’s energy in another form.
2. **Practical**:
   - It allows for straightforward calculations in relativistic contexts, where the total energy of a particle includes both its rest energy and kinetic energy.

---

### **Summary**
The \( c^2 \) in "eV/\( c^2 \)" ensures consistency with the mass-energy equivalence formula. It reminds us that mass is fundamentally a form of energy, and \( c^2 \) serves as the conversion factor in this equivalence. In particle physics, this unit simplifies calculations and aligns mass with energy scales commonly used in the field.
