In this example, the **stationary observer \( S \)** serves as the **reference frame** against which all other velocities are measured initially. \( S \) does not move, and it acts as the baseline or starting point for analyzing the motion of all the elephants.

### **Clarification of Roles**
1. **Stationary Observer \( S \)**:
   - Located in the **rest frame**.
   - Sees the first elephant \( E_1 \) moving at velocity \( v_1 \).
   - All velocities (e.g., \( v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n \)) are defined **relative to \( S \) initially**.

2. **Moving Observers \( E_1, E_2, \dots, E_n \)**:
   - \( E_1 \): The first elephant moves at velocity \( v_1 \) relative to \( S \).
   - \( E_2 \): The second elephant moves at velocity \( v_2 \) **relative to \( E_1 \)**.
   - \( E_n \): Each subsequent elephant moves at velocity \( v_n \) **relative to the previous elephant**.

3. **Nested Frames**:
   - \( E_1 \), \( E_2 \), etc., are reference frames that move relative to \( S \).
   - The velocities must be **combined relativistically** to determine the total motion relative to \( S \).

---

### **Where \( S \) Is Observing From**
The stationary observer \( S \):
- Sees \( E_1 \) moving at \( v_1 \).
- Sees \( E_2 \) moving at a combined velocity \( v_{\text{total},2} \), derived from \( v_1 \) and \( v_2 \) using relativistic velocity addition:
  \[
  v_{\text{total},2} = \frac{v_1 + v_2}{1 + \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}.
  \]
- Sees all subsequent elephants \( E_n \) moving with increasingly complex velocities relative to \( S \).

---

### **Visualizing the Scenario**
Imagine the following:
1. **Frame \( S \) (Rest Frame)**:  
   - Standing on the ground, stationary.

2. **Elephant \( E_1 \) at \( v_1 \)**:  
   - Runs on a racetrack moving at velocity \( v_1 \) relative to \( S \).

3. **Elephant \( E_2 \) at \( v_2 \)**:  
   - Runs on a racetrack carried by \( E_1 \) at velocity \( v_2 \) relative to \( E_1 \).

4. **Elephant \( E_n \) at \( v_n \)**:  
   - Runs on a racetrack carried by \( E_{n-1} \), moving at \( v_n \) relative to \( E_{n-1} \).

The observer \( S \) sees all elephants in motion, but their velocities must be calculated using the **relativistic velocity addition formula**.

---

### **Relative Observers \( k \) and \( k_1 \)**
Now, suppose \( k \) (an observer) is riding with \( E_n \), and \( k_1 \) is riding with \( E_{n_1} \):
- \( k \) sees their local velocity as **zero** (they are stationary relative to their own frame).
- \( k_1 \) sees motion relative to \( k \) as the difference in their total velocities, calculated relativistically.

The stationary observer \( S \) observes the motion of all elephants, including the observers \( k \) and \( k_1 \).

---

### **Key Takeaway**:
The **stationary observer \( S \)**:
- Acts as the **reference frame** against which all velocities are initially measured.
- Observes each nested frame's motion but must account for **relativistic velocity addition** to combine the velocities correctly.
