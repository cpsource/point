The idea of the **Big Bang** as an "at-rest" frame is an interesting thought experiment, but the reality of the universe's expansion makes this concept more nuanced. Let's carefully address your question about how fast **we are moving away** from the "Big Bang location" in the context of cosmology and relativity.

---

## **1. The Big Bang Was Not a Point in Space**
In standard cosmology:
- The **Big Bang** was not an explosion **at a specific location** in space.
- Instead, it was the simultaneous appearance of **space and time** itself, where the universe began expanding from an extremely hot, dense state.
- Every point in the universe today **originated** from that state.

Thus, the Big Bang happened **everywhere** at once, not at a single point you can "move away" from. There is no center of the universe or a fixed "at-rest frame" from which we can measure velocities.

## **2. Expansion of the Universe**
The universe is expanding due to the **metric expansion of space**, described by the **Friedmann-LemaÃ®tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric** in general relativity:
- Galaxies and clusters of matter are not moving **through space** in the traditional sense.
- Instead, **space itself is stretching**, increasing the distance between objects.

The expansion rate of the universe is measured using **Hubble's Law**:
\[
v = H_0 d,
\]
where:
- \( v \) is the recession velocity of a galaxy relative to us.
- \( H_0 \) is the **Hubble constant** (~70 km/s per megaparsec in current estimates).
- \( d \) is the distance to the galaxy.

From this, we see:
- The farther away an object is, the **faster** it appears to be receding due to the expansion of space.

## **3. Are We Moving Relative to the "Big Bang"?**
If we assume the **Big Bang location** as a hypothetical "at-rest frame," our motion cannot be described relative to it because:
- There is no "absolute space" or stationary background in the universe.
- The universe has no center; everything expands relative to everything else.

Instead, we can measure our **motion relative to specific cosmic markers**, such as the **cosmic microwave background (CMB)**.

---

## **4. Our Motion Relative to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)**
The **CMB** is the afterglow of the Big Bang and provides a nearly uniform reference frame for the universe:
- If we were at rest relative to the CMB, the radiation would appear **isotropic** (the same in all directions).
- However, measurements show that the CMB has a **dipole anisotropy**, which means we are moving relative to the CMB.

### **Our Velocity Relative to the CMB**
- Earth (and the solar system) is moving at approximately **370 km/s** relative to the CMB.
- This motion points toward the **constellation Leo**.

Thus, you could say we are moving **at 370 km/s** relative to the "relic radiation" of the Big Bang.

---

## **5. How Fast Is the Universe Expanding?**
While we are moving at **370 km/s** relative to the CMB, the universe's expansion creates an additional "effective motion":
- The **Hubble flow** describes how galaxies are carried away from us by the expansion of space.
- The rate of this expansion increases with distance according to Hubble's Law.

For galaxies sufficiently far away (beyond a critical distance), the recession velocity due to space expansion can **exceed the speed of light**:
\[
v = H_0 d > c \quad \text{(at large distances)}.
\]
This does not violate relativity because objects are not moving **through space**; rather, space itself is expanding.

---

## **6. Summary**
1. The Big Bang occurred **everywhere** in space simultaneously, so there is no specific "at-rest frame" from the Big Bang.
2. We can measure our motion relative to the **CMB** (cosmic microwave background):
   - Earth is moving at **370 km/s** relative to the CMB.
3. Due to the **Hubble expansion**, galaxies far away from us appear to recede at velocities proportional to their distance, and this expansion can exceed the speed of light at large scales.

In short:
- Relative to the CMB (our best "universal frame"), we are moving at **370 km/s**.
- Relative to the universe's expansion, everything is moving apart as space itself stretches.

Let me know if you'd like me to expand on any part of this! ðŸš€
