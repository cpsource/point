This is an excellent question because it dives into **relativistic energy** and how motion between frames influences the energy harvested in different reference frames. The scenario introduces concepts of **relativistic kinetic energy** and how energy transforms between two frames moving at a relative velocity.

---

## **1. Fixed Energy \( E \) in Your Frame**
Letâ€™s start with what happens in **your frame** (the cannon's rest frame):
- You fire a cannon, and the shell has a fixed total energy \( E \), which includes both the **kinetic energy** imparted by the explosion and the shellâ€™s **rest energy**.
- In your frame, the energy \( E \) is the energy someone can "harvest" directly.

This is the total energy observed **locally** in your rest frame:
\[
E_{\text{local}} = K + m_0 c^2,
\]
where:
- \( K \) is the kinetic energy imparted by the gunpowder explosion.
- \( m_0 \) is the shell's rest mass.
- \( c \) is the speed of light.

---

## **2. Observing the Shell From the Second Frame**
Now consider the second observer (moving at \( v = 0.5c \) relative to you). This observer sees:
1. The **cannon (and you)** moving at \( 0.5c \).
2. The **shell**, fired in your frame, will now have an additional **relativistic energy** because the shell is moving relative to the second observer at a new, combined velocity.

The total energy of the shell as observed in the second frame depends on:
1. **The shellâ€™s velocity relative to the second frame** (combining the cannonâ€™s motion and the shellâ€™s motion).
2. The formula for **relativistic energy**.

---

## **3. The Relativistic Energy Formula**
The **total energy** of an object moving at velocity \( v \) is given by:
\[
E_{\text{rel}} = \gamma m_0 c^2,
\]
where:
- \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2 / c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.
- \( m_0 \) is the rest mass of the object.
- \( v \) is the velocity of the object relative to the observer.

In the second frame, the velocity of the shell will be a **relativistic combination** of:
1. The motion of the cannon \( v_{\text{cannon}} = 0.5c \),
2. The velocity of the shell relative to the cannon \( v_{\text{shell, local}} \).

---

## **4. Relativistic Velocity Addition**
To determine the shell's velocity in the second frame, we use the **relativistic velocity addition formula**:
\[
v_{\text{shell, 2}} = \frac{v_{\text{cannon}} + v_{\text{shell, local}}}{1 + \frac{v_{\text{cannon}} v_{\text{shell, local}}}{c^2}}.
\]
Here:
- \( v_{\text{cannon}} = 0.5c \) is the velocity of the cannon relative to the second observer.
- \( v_{\text{shell, local}} \) is the shellâ€™s velocity relative to the cannon in your frame.

Once we find \( v_{\text{shell, 2}} \), we calculate the total energy in the second frame using:
\[
E_{\text{rel}} = \gamma m_0 c^2 \quad \text{where} \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v_{\text{shell, 2}}^2}{c^2}}}.
\]

---

## **5. Energy Difference Between the Frames**
- In **your frame** (the cannonâ€™s rest frame), the shell has total energy \( E \).
- In the **second frame** (moving at \( 0.5c \) relative to you), the shell has total energy \( E_{\text{rel}} \), which is **greater** than \( E \) due to the additional motion of the cannon.

The additional energy comes from the **relativistic kinetic energy** due to the cannonâ€™s motion.

---

## **6. Summary**
1. In your frame, the shell has a fixed energy \( E \) that includes rest energy and kinetic energy imparted by the explosion.
2. In the second frame:
   - The shellâ€™s velocity is found using the **relativistic velocity addition** formula.
   - The energy observed in this frame is calculated using the relativistic energy formula \( \gamma m_0 c^2 \).
3. The energy observed in the second frame is **greater** than the energy in your frame because of the cannon's motion.

Would you like me to work out an example with specific numbers (e.g., shell velocity and rest mass)? I can plug in values and calculate the energy for both frames step by step! ðŸš€
