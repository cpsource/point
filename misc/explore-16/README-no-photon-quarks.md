No, **photons do not have quarks**. Photons are **fundamental particles** in the Standard Model of Particle Physics and are classified as **bosons**, specifically the **force carriers of the electromagnetic force**. Here's why photons don't have quarks:

---

### **1. Photons Are Elementary Particles**
- Photons are one of the gauge bosons in the Standard Model.
- They are **elementary**, meaning they are not made up of smaller constituents like quarks or gluons.
- Unlike protons, neutrons, and other hadrons, photons do not have an internal structure.

---

### **2. Quarks Are Fermions, Photons Are Bosons**
- **Quarks** are **fermions**:
  - They have half-integer spin (\( \frac{1}{2} \)).
  - They combine to form composite particles like protons and neutrons.
- **Photons** are **bosons**:
  - They have integer spin (spin-1).
  - They mediate the electromagnetic force and do not participate in the strong nuclear force that governs quarks.

---

### **3. Photons and the Strong Nuclear Force**
- Quarks are bound together by the **strong nuclear force**, mediated by **gluons**.
- Photons do not interact via the strong nuclear force. Instead, they interact with charged particles through the **electromagnetic force**.

---

### **4. Properties of Photons**
- Photons are massless (in a vacuum) and travel at the speed of light (\( c \)).
- They have no electric charge.
- They exhibit wave-particle duality, behaving as both waves and particles depending on the context.

### **5. Quarks vs. Photons: Fundamental Differences**
| Property            | Quarks                     | Photons                 |
|---------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| Type                | Fermions                  | Bosons                  |
| Spin                | \( \frac{1}{2} \)         | 1                       |
| Composition         | Fundamental but combine to form hadrons | Fundamental (no substructure) |
| Interaction Forces  | Strong, weak, electromagnetic | Electromagnetic         |
| Mass                | Nonzero                   | Zero (in a vacuum)      |

---

### **6. Why Photons Donâ€™t Have Quarks**
- Quarks are bound by the strong nuclear force, forming composite particles like protons and neutrons.
- Photons, as force carriers, are responsible for electromagnetic interactions and are not subject to the strong nuclear force.
- There is no mechanism in the Standard Model that allows photons to have quarks or any internal structure.

---

### **Conclusion**
Photons are fundamentally different from particles like protons, neutrons, and mesons, which are made of quarks. Photons are indivisible, elementary particles that mediate the electromagnetic force, whereas quarks are constituents of matter bound together by the strong nuclear force.
