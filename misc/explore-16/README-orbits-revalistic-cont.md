To determine \( r \) (the orbital radius) as a function of \( v_1 \) (orbital velocity) while incorporating relativistic effects, we rearrange the equations derived earlier. Here's the step-by-step math:

---

### **1. Start with the Centripetal Force and Gravitational Force**
For a stable orbit:
\[
\frac{m_\text{rel} \cdot v_1^2}{r} = \frac{G \cdot m_2 \cdot m_\text{rel}}{r^2}
\]

Here:
- \( m_\text{rel} \): Relativistic mass increase observed by \( m_2 \):
  \[
  m_\text{rel} = \frac{m_\text{rest}}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v_1^2}{c^2}}}
  \]

Cancel \( m_\text{rel} \), since it appears on both sides of the equation:
\[
\frac{v_1^2}{r} = \frac{G \cdot m_2}{r^2}
\]

---

### **2. Solve for \( r \)**
Rearranging for \( r \):
\[
r = \frac{G \cdot m_2}{v_1^2}
\]

---

### **3. Include Relativistic Effects**
The gravitational force and the effective radius \( r \) are influenced by the relativistic mass, even though it cancels out in this particular calculation. The equation remains:
\[
r = \frac{G \cdot m_2}{v_1^2}
\]

But \( v_1 \) must be constrained such that \( v_1 < c \), which is enforced naturally by relativity.

---

### **4. Key Relationships**
- \( r \) is inversely proportional to \( v_1^2 \).
- As \( v_1 \to c \), \( r \to 0 \), which aligns with the physical constraint that an object cannot orbit at \( c \).

---

### **Numerical Example**
Letâ€™s calculate \( r \) for Earthâ€™s mass:
- Gravitational constant: \( G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2} \),
- Earthâ€™s mass: \( m_2 = 5.972 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} \),
- Orbital velocity \( v_1 = 7.5 \, \text{km/s} = 7.5 \times 10^3 \, \text{m/s} \).

\[
r = \frac{(6.674 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot (5.972 \times 10^{24})}{(7.5 \times 10^3)^2}
\]

\[
r \approx 7.11 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}.
\]

This result corresponds to the orbital radius of a low-Earth orbit satellite.

---

### **5. Relating \( r \) to Relativistic Observations**
Although \( r \) can be computed directly, relativistic effects influence:
1. **The time dilation** experienced by the orbiting object.
2. **The observed mass increase (\( \Delta m \))** of the orbiting object, which affects energy balance but does not change \( r \).
