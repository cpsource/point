That's a fascinating question! If you **could make no observations** (meaning you are completely isolated from external reference points, signals, or interactions), you would be unable to measure motion, mass, or time **relative to any other frame**. However, physics still imposes constraints, and mass and time **are not arbitrary**‚Äîthey depend on the laws of **relativity**.

Let‚Äôs break this down step by step.

---

## **1. Motion and Observations**
In relativity:
- All motion is **relative**: Without external observations, there‚Äôs no way to determine whether you are moving or at rest. Motion would appear meaningless in a completely isolated frame.
- You can only measure your velocity or relativistic effects relative to another **observer** or **frame of reference**.

Thus, without external observations:
- **Velocity** is undefined.
- **Relative time dilation**, **length contraction**, and **mass increase** cannot be measured because they require comparison to another frame.

---

## **2. Can Mass Be Any Value?**

### **Rest Mass Is Invariant**
- An object's **rest mass** (\( m_0 \)) is a fundamental property of the object. It **does not change** regardless of motion or isolation.
- Even if you cannot observe anything, the object's rest mass exists as part of its intrinsic nature.

### **Relativistic Mass Requires Motion**
The **relativistic mass** depends on velocity relative to some observer:
\[
m = \frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}.
\]
- Without an external reference to determine \( v \) (velocity), relativistic mass is undefined. It is **not arbitrary**‚Äîit simply cannot be measured.

Thus, if no observations can be made:
- **Rest mass remains well-defined** (it is intrinsic).
- **Relativistic mass** becomes meaningless without a velocity to compare to.

## **3. Can Elapsed Time Be Any Value?**

### **Time and Clocks**
- Time in your frame (proper time) still **ticks normally** according to your local clock, even if you are completely isolated.
- You cannot arbitrarily decide elapsed time; it is governed by the flow of time within your own reference frame.

### **Time Dilation Needs Comparison**
The equation for time dilation is:
\[
\Delta t' = \frac{\Delta t}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}},
\]
where \( \Delta t \) is the time measured by a stationary observer, and \( v \) is the relative velocity.

Without another frame of reference:
- **There‚Äôs no ‚Äúexternal clock‚Äù to compare to**, so time dilation cannot be observed or measured.
- However, this does **not mean time stops** or becomes arbitrary‚Äîit still flows according to the internal clocks in your frame.

---

## **4. What‚Äôs Real If No Observations Are Possible?**

Even if you cannot observe external reference points:
1. **Rest Mass**: Your mass remains a constant, intrinsic property.
2. **Proper Time**: Time in your own frame (measured by local clocks) ticks normally.
3. **Energy**: Energy remains defined locally based on internal processes.

What you **cannot determine**:
- Your velocity (\( v \)).
- Your relativistic mass.
- Whether you are undergoing time dilation relative to another observer.

---

## **5. Thought Experiment: Absolute Isolation**
Imagine you are in a perfectly sealed box, cut off from all light, signals, and observations:
- You feel no motion if your velocity is constant (no acceleration).
- Your local clock runs normally, and you can still measure time within the box.
- Your mass is constant at its rest mass \( m_0 \).

What you cannot determine:
- Whether you are moving at 0.1c, 0.9c, or even perfectly at rest.
- Any relativistic effects because those require comparison with external frames.

---

## **6. Key Takeaway**
If you cannot observe anything:
- **Rest mass** and **proper time** are still well-defined and intrinsic to your frame.
- **Relativistic mass**, time dilation, and velocity become meaningless because they require comparison to external frames.
- Physics still governs internal processes, but **motion, time dilation, and relativistic effects are not observable or measurable** in complete isolation.
