If we eliminate \( m_1 \) entirely and instead consider the **relativistic effects on mass (\( \Delta m \)) as seen from \( m_2 \)**, we can rewrite the relationship in terms of the observable quantities like \( \Delta m \), \( v_1 \), \( r \), and \( G \). Hereâ€™s the revised derivation:

---

### **1. Gravitational Force as Seen from \( m_2 \)**
The gravitational force \( F_\text{gravity} \) between \( m_2 \) and Observer 1, accounting for relativistic mass increase \( \Delta m \), is:
\[
F_\text{gravity} = \frac{G \cdot \Delta m \cdot m_2}{r^2}
\]

Here, \( \Delta m \) is the relativistic mass difference observed by \( m_2 \), given by:
\[
\Delta m = \frac{m_\text{rest}}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v_1^2}{c^2}}} - m_\text{rest}
\]

---

### **2. Centripetal Force**
The centripetal force required for a stable orbit as seen by \( m_2 \) is:
\[
F_\text{centripetal} = \frac{\Delta m \cdot v_1^2}{r}
\]

---

### **3. Equilibrium Condition**
For a stable orbit, \( F_\text{centripetal} = F_\text{gravity} \):
\[
\frac{\Delta m \cdot v_1^2}{r} = \frac{G \cdot \Delta m \cdot m_2}{r^2}
\]

Cancel \( \Delta m \) (assuming \( \Delta m \neq 0 \)):
\[
\frac{v_1^2}{r} = \frac{G \cdot m_2}{r^2}
\]

Simplify to solve for \( v_1^2 \):
\[
v_1^2 = \frac{G \cdot m_2}{r}
\]

---

### **4. Observing the Relativistic Effects**
The key relativistic insight here is not just the velocity, but the change in the observed mass \( \Delta m \) as \( v_1 \to c \). From \( m_2 \)'s perspective:
\[
\Delta m = \frac{m_\text{rest}}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v_1^2}{c^2}}} - m_\text{rest}
\]

This increase in \( \Delta m \):
1. Alters the gravitational force observed.
2. Increases the inertia of the orbiting body, requiring higher tangential velocity for stability.

---

### **5. Final Relativistic Relationship**
Expressing \( v_1 \) in terms of \( r \) and \( \Delta m \) explicitly:
\[
v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{G \cdot m_2}{r}} \quad \text{(classical velocity)}
\]
\[
\Delta m = \frac{\sqrt{G \cdot m_2 / r}}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v_1^2}{c^2}}} - \sqrt{G \cdot m_2 / r}
\]

As \( v_1 \) increases, \( \Delta m \) becomes significant, affecting both the orbit dynamics and the observed energy balance from \( m_2 \)'s perspective.

---

### **Key Points**
1. **Stable Orbit Velocity**:
   The velocity \( v_1 \) for a stable orbit is unchanged in its classical form but gains relativistic corrections from the mass term \( \Delta m \).

2. **Relativistic Mass Increase**:
   The increase in \( \Delta m \) contributes to the effective gravitational force, which is seen as enhanced inertia at higher velocities.

3. **High-Velocity Limit**:
   As \( v_1 \to c \), \( \Delta m \to \infty \), preventing \( v_1 \) from exceeding \( c \), consistent with relativity.
