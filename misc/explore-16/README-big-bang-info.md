The **370 km/s** velocity relative to the **cosmic microwave background (CMB)** refers to our **constant motion** as part of the solar system moving through the universe. However, there is **no measurable acceleration** directly associated with this motion because it is not due to any force actively changing our speed.

---

## **1. Why Is There No Acceleration?**
### Constant Velocity Relative to the CMB
- The **370 km/s** velocity is a constant, not changing over time, meaning the **acceleration** in this frame is **zero**.
- This motion is akin to a straight-line inertial motion, where no force is acting to alter the speed or direction.

### Expanding Universe and Hubble Flow
While the universe is expanding, **we (the Milky Way)** are not being accelerated **locally** by the Hubble expansion:
- The galaxies and objects in our **local group** of galaxies are gravitationally bound, which counteracts the expansion of space on these smaller scales.
- Thus, the solar system and Milky Way are not "accelerating away" from the Big Bang center in any direct sense.

However, on **large cosmic scales** where gravitational binding does not dominate:
- Space itself is expanding, and distant galaxies **appear** to accelerate away from us due to the metric expansion of space.

## **2. Cosmic Acceleration: Dark Energy**
While **we** do not experience any measurable acceleration locally, the universe's expansion is **accelerating** on a large scale due to **dark energy**.

The acceleration of the universe's expansion is described using the **second Friedmann equation** in general relativity. The key equation is:
\[
\frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = -\frac{4\pi G}{3} \left( \rho + 3P/c^2 \right),
\]
where:
- \( a(t) \): Scale factor of the universe.
- \( \ddot{a} \): The second derivative of the scale factor (cosmic acceleration).
- \( \rho \): Density of the universe.
- \( P \): Pressure (dark energy exerts negative pressure).
- \( G \): Gravitational constant.

The presence of **dark energy** drives the acceleration of space expansion, and this has been confirmed by observations of distant supernovae, cosmic microwave background (CMB), and large-scale structure.

### **Measured Cosmic Acceleration**
The acceleration due to dark energy is incredibly small. The universe's rate of acceleration is roughly:
\[
\ddot{a} \sim 10^{-10} \, \text{m/s}^2.
\]

## **3. Our Local Motion Is Not Accelerating**
The **370 km/s** speed relative to the CMB remains roughly constant because:
- No forces are accelerating the solar system relative to the CMB.
- Local gravitational effects dominate at the scale of the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, preventing space expansion from causing acceleration.

The expansion of the universe applies primarily to **large-scale, unbound systems**, not gravitationally bound regions like our galaxy or solar system.

---

## **4. Key Takeaways**
1. **Local Motion**: Our motion at \( 370 \, \text{km/s} \) relative to the CMB is **constant**, so the acceleration is effectively **zero** in this context.
2. **Cosmic Expansion**: The universe's expansion is accelerating due to **dark energy**, but this is not directly measurable for our local system.
3. **Dark Energyâ€™s Acceleration**: The acceleration of the universe's expansion is very small, around \( 10^{-10} \, \text{m/s}^2 \).
