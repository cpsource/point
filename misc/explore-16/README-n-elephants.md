This problem is a fascinating exploration of **relative motion** and **nested velocities** in the framework of **special relativity**. It requires generalizing motion for multiple nested observers (e.g., elephants), each carrying a moving platform with additional motion.

We can use **Lorentz transformations** to describe what observer \( k \) at level \( n \) would see relative to another observer \( k_1 \) at level \( n_1 \). The velocities \( v, v_1, \dots, v_n \) must be **combined relativistically** to account for the fact that velocities do not add linearly when approaching the speed of light (\( c \)).

---

## **1. Generalized Problem Setup**

- There are \( n \) elephants running along a series of moving race tracks.
- Elephant \( E_1 \) runs at velocity \( v_1 \) relative to a stationary observer \( S \).
- Elephant \( E_2 \) runs at velocity \( v_2 \) relative to \( E_1 \)'s frame of reference.
- Generalizing further, Elephant \( E_n \) runs at velocity \( v_n \) relative to the previous elephant's frame \( E_{n-1} \).

We aim to calculate what **observer \( k \) at level \( n \)** sees relative to another **observer \( k_1 \) at level \( n_1 \)**.

## **2. Relativistic Velocity Addition**

In special relativity, when combining velocities \( u \) and \( v \) along the same direction, the **relativistic velocity addition formula** is:
\[
v_{\text{combined}} = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}.
\]

### Extending for Multiple Velocities:
To generalize this for \( n \) velocities \( v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n \), the velocities must be combined **sequentially**:
1. Combine \( v_1 \) and \( v_2 \) first.
2. Use the result to combine with \( v_3 \), and so on.

The recursive formula for the \( n \)-th velocity \( v_{\text{total}} \) relative to the stationary observer is:
\[
v_{\text{total}, n} = \frac{v_{n-1} + v_n}{1 + \frac{v_{n-1} v_n}{c^2}}.
\]
where \( v_1 \) is the velocity of the first elephant relative to the stationary observer.

---

## **3. Observations Between Different Levels**

Now, suppose **observer \( k \)** is riding on elephant \( E_n \), and **observer \( k_1 \)** is on elephant \( E_{n_1} \), where \( n \neq n_1 \). 

1. First, compute the total velocities of \( E_n \) and \( E_{n_1} \) relative to the stationary observer \( S \):
   \[
   v_{\text{total}, n} = \frac{\dots \frac{\left(v_1 + v_2\right)}{1 + \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}} + v_3}{1 + \frac{v_{\text{combined}} v_3}{c^2}} \dots
   \]
   Repeat until \( v_n \) or \( v_{n_1} \) is reached.

2. To determine what \( k \) sees relative to \( k_1 \), **subtract the velocities relativistically**:
   If \( v_{\text{total}, n} \) is the total velocity of \( k \) (at level \( n \)) and \( v_{\text{total}, n_1} \) is the velocity of \( k_1 \) (at level \( n_1 \)), the relative velocity is:
   \[
   v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_{\text{total}, n} - v_{\text{total}, n_1}}{1 - \frac{v_{\text{total}, n} v_{\text{total}, n_1}}{c^2}}.
   \]

---

## **4. Generalized Observations**

### Case 1: **What Observer \( k \) Sees (at \( E_n \))**
- Observer \( k \) perceives their local velocity as zero (they are stationary in their frame).
- They observe Elephant \( E_{n-1} \) moving at velocity \( v_n \) relative to them.

### Case 2: **Relative Motion Between \( k \) and \( k_1 \)**
- The velocity \( v_{\text{rel}} \) combines the total motion of the two observers \( k \) and \( k_1 \) using the relativistic subtraction formula.

---

## **5. Example: Two Elephants**

Suppose:
- Elephant \( E_1 \) runs at \( v_1 = 0.6c \) relative to a stationary observer.
- Elephant \( E_2 \) runs at \( v_2 = 0.5c \) relative to \( E_1 \).

1. Combine \( v_1 \) and \( v_2 \) using the velocity addition formula:
\[
v_{\text{total}, 2} = \frac{v_1 + v_2}{1 + \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}.
\]
Substitute:
\[
v_{\text{total}, 2} = \frac{0.6c + 0.5c}{1 + \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{1.1c}{1 + 0.3} = \frac{1.1c}{1.3} \approx 0.846c.
\]

2. If observer \( k \) is at \( E_2 \) and observer \( k_1 \) is at \( E_1 \), the relative velocity is:
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_{\text{total}, 2} - v_1}{1 - \frac{v_{\text{total}, 2} v_1}{c^2}}.
\]
Substitute \( v_{\text{total}, 2} = 0.846c \) and \( v_1 = 0.6c \):
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.846c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.846c)(0.6c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.246c}{1 - 0.5076} = \frac{0.246c}{0.4924} \approx 0.5c.
\]

---

## **6. Generalizing for \( n \) Elephants**

By **induction**:
1. Combine all \( v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n \) sequentially using the relativistic velocity addition formula.
2. Compute the total velocities \( v_{\text{total}, n} \) and \( v_{\text{total}, n_1} \) for any two observers \( k \) and \( k_1 \).
3. Use the relativistic subtraction formula to calculate their relative velocity.

---

## **7. Summary**
- Velocities combine **relativistically**, not linearly, due to the constraints of special relativity.
- The relative velocity between any two observers \( k \) (at level \( n \)) and \( k_1 \) (at level \( n_1 \)) is:
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_{\text{total}, n} - v_{\text{total}, n_1}}{1 - \frac{v_{\text{total}, n} v_{\text{total}, n_1}}{c^2}}.
\]
- This ensures that no matter how many elephants (or layers of motion) exist, no velocity exceeds the speed of light (\( c \)).
