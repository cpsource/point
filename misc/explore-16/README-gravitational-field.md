To derive a **gravitational potential field** using the **SigmoLorentz Transfer Function**, we aim to describe how mass-energy creates localized distortions in sub-space, analogous to the potential field in Newtonian gravity. Here's a step-by-step derivation:

---

### **1. Gravitational Potential in Newtonian Gravity**
In classical mechanics, the gravitational potential \( \Phi(r) \) for a point mass \( M \) is:
\[
\Phi(r) = -\frac{GM}{r},
\]
where:
- \( G \): Gravitational constant,
- \( M \): Mass of the object,
- \( r \): Distance from the mass.

This potential is the integral of the gravitational force:
\[
\Phi(r) = -\int F(r) \, dr = -\int \frac{GM}{r^2} \, dr.
\]

---

### **2. Gravitational Potential with SigmoLorentz**
The SigmoLorentz Transfer Function \( T(v, x) \) introduces non-linear effects:
\[
T(v, x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\alpha v}} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + \frac{x^2}{\gamma^2}}.
\]
Here:
- The **Lorentzian term** \( \frac{1}{1 + \frac{x^2}{\gamma^2}} \) represents spatial dependence (\( x = r \) for radial distance).
- The **Sigmoid term** \( \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\alpha v}} \) accounts for velocity effects, but we initially focus on static systems where \( v \approx 0 \).

#### Static Case (\( v = 0 \)):
For a stationary mass, the sigmoid term reduces to \( \frac{1}{1 + e^0} = 0.5 \), simplifying \( T(r) \) to:
\[
T(r) = \frac{0.5}{1 + \frac{r^2}{\gamma^2}}.
\]

---

### **3. Gravitational Potential as a Function of \( r \)**
The gravitational potential \( \Phi(r) \) is derived by integrating the field strength \( T(r) \) over distance:
\[
\Phi(r) = -\int_0^r T(r') \, dr'.
\]

Substituting \( T(r') \):
\[
\Phi(r) = -\int_0^r \frac{0.5}{1 + \frac{{r'}^2}{\gamma^2}} \, dr'.
\]

---

### **4. Solving the Integral**
The integral simplifies using a substitution:
Let \( u = \frac{r'}{\gamma} \), so \( r' = \gamma u \) and \( dr' = \gamma \, du \):
\[
\Phi(r) = -0.5 \gamma \int_0^{r/\gamma} \frac{1}{1 + u^2} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int \frac{1}{1 + u^2} \, du \) is the arctangent function:
\[
\int \frac{1}{1 + u^2} \, du = \arctan(u).
\]

Thus:
\[
\Phi(r) = -0.5 \gamma \left[ \arctan\left(\frac{r}{\gamma}\right) \right]_0^{r/\gamma}.
\]

Evaluating the bounds:
\[
\Phi(r) = -0.5 \gamma \arctan\left(\frac{r}{\gamma}\right).
\]

---

### **5. Behavior of \( \Phi(r) \)**
1. **Small Distances (\( r \ll \gamma \))**:
   - For small \( r \), \( \arctan\left(\frac{r}{\gamma}\right) \approx \frac{r}{\gamma} \).
   - The potential becomes approximately:
     \[
     \Phi(r) \approx -0.5 r.
     \]

2. **Large Distances (\( r \gg \gamma \))**:
   - For large \( r \), \( \arctan\left(\frac{r}{\gamma}\right) \to \frac{\pi}{2} \).
   - The potential asymptotes to:
     \[
     \Phi(r) \to -0.5 \gamma \frac{\pi}{2}.
     \]

---

### **6. Generalized Gravitational Potential**
If we reintroduce velocity dependence, the potential becomes:
\[
\Phi(r) = -\int_0^r \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\alpha v}} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + \frac{r'^2}{\gamma^2}} \, dr'.
\]
This integral would need to account for \( v \) as a function of \( r \), introducing additional complexity.

---

### **7. Interpretation of Results**
- The SigmoLorentz model introduces **localized behavior** via the Lorentzian term and **non-linear corrections** via the Sigmoid term.
- At small scales (\( r \ll \gamma \)), the potential grows linearly, while at large scales, it saturates to a constant value, differing from the inverse-square law.
- This saturation might explain deviations from Newtonian gravity in extreme conditions, such as near black holes or at cosmological scales.
