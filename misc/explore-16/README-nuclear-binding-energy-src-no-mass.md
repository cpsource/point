Defining **nuclear binding energy** without invoking the concept of mass involves focusing directly on the **energy dynamics** of the system. Here’s an alternative explanation:

---

### **Nuclear Binding Energy in Terms of Forces and Energy Dynamics**
Nuclear binding energy is the amount of **energy required to overcome the strong nuclear force** that holds the protons and neutrons (nucleons) together in the nucleus. It represents the **stability of the nucleus** and arises from the following principles:

---

### **1. Potential Energy in the Strong Nuclear Force**
- When nucleons are brought very close together (~\(10^{-15}\) meters), they interact via the **strong nuclear force**, which is highly attractive at these scales.
- This attraction lowers the total **potential energy** of the nucleons, creating a **bound system**.
- The binding energy is this **negative potential energy**, which must be supplied to break the nucleus apart.

---

### **2. Balance of Forces**
The nucleus is a delicate balance between:
- **Attractive Force**: The strong nuclear force pulls nucleons together.
- **Repulsive Force**: The electromagnetic force (from positively charged protons) pushes them apart.
- Binding energy reflects the net **energy barrier** created by the dominance of the strong nuclear force over electromagnetic repulsion in a stable nucleus.

---

### **3. Energy Dynamics Without Mass**
- When nucleons come together to form a nucleus, their **total energy decreases** because the attractive strong nuclear force draws them into a lower-energy state.
- This energy is **not lost** but is released in the form of radiation or kinetic energy during the binding process.
- The binding energy is thus the **energy difference** between the nucleons’ unbound (high-energy) state and their bound (low-energy) state.

---

### **4. Energy Conservation Perspective**
- The system’s total energy remains constant.
- The **binding energy** is the portion of energy stored in the **configuration of the nuclear force field**.
- To separate the nucleons, this exact amount of energy must be supplied back into the system to overcome the attractive forces.

---

### **Analogy: Gravitational Potential Energy**
Imagine two objects in space:
- As they move closer, they lose **gravitational potential energy**, and this energy is emitted as heat, light, or another form of energy.
- Similarly, when nucleons come together, the strong nuclear force lowers their total energy, releasing the binding energy.

---

### **Summary**
Nuclear binding energy is the **energy stored in the configuration of the strong nuclear force field** when nucleons are bound together. It represents the energy needed to overcome this field and separate the nucleons into an unbound state. This explanation relies solely on the dynamics of forces and energy, avoiding references to mass altogether.
