To place **Observer 1** into a stable orbit around **Observer 2**, we need to balance the **centripetal force** required for circular motion with the **gravitational force** between the two masses. Here's how to derive the relationship between \( v_1 \) (the orbital velocity) and \( r \) (the orbital radius):

---

### **1. Gravitational Force**
The gravitational force acting between the two observers is given by Newton's law of gravitation:
\[
F_\text{gravity} = \frac{G \cdot m_1 \cdot m_2}{r^2}
\]
where:
- \( G \) = gravitational constant (\( 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2} \)),
- \( m_1 \) = mass of Observer 1,
- \( m_2 \) = mass of Observer 2,
- \( r \) = distance (radius of the orbit).

---

### **2. Centripetal Force**
To maintain a circular orbit, the centripetal force needed is:
\[
F_\text{centripetal} = \frac{m_1 \cdot v_1^2}{r}
\]
where:
- \( v_1 \) = orbital velocity of Observer 1.

---

### **3. Equilibrium Condition**
For a stable orbit, the centripetal force must equal the gravitational force:
\[
\frac{m_1 \cdot v_1^2}{r} = \frac{G \cdot m_1 \cdot m_2}{r^2}
\]

Cancel \( m_1 \) (assuming \( m_1 \neq 0 \)) and rearrange to solve for \( v_1 \):
\[
v_1^2 = \frac{G \cdot m_2}{r}
\]

Take the square root:
\[
v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{G \cdot m_2}{r}}
\]

---

### **4. Relationship Between \( v_1 \) and \( r \)**
- \( v_1 \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{r}} \): Orbital velocity decreases as the square root of the radius.
- This relationship implies that closer orbits require higher speeds to maintain stability.

---

### **5. Key Implications**
- For small \( r \), \( v_1 \) becomes very large.
- For large \( r \), \( v_1 \) becomes small, approaching zero as \( r \to \infty \).

---

### **6. Example: Earth and Satellites**
For a satellite orbiting Earth:
- Earthâ€™s mass: \( m_2 = 5.972 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} \),
- Gravitational constant: \( G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2} \).

Using \( r = 7,000 \, \text{km} = 7 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} \):
\[
v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{(6.674 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot (5.972 \times 10^{24})}{7 \times 10^6}} \approx 7.5 \, \text{km/s}.
\]

---

### **7. Assumptions**
- The orbit is circular (eccentricity \( e = 0 \)).
- Relativistic effects are negligible.
- Only gravitational forces act on the system.
