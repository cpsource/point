Light slows down in a medium like glass due to interactions between the **electromagnetic wave of light** and the **atomic structure of the material**. This phenomenon can be explained using the concepts of **refraction**, **electromagnetic wave propagation**, and **optical density**.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation:

---

### **1. Light in Vacuum vs. Medium**
- In a **vacuum**, light travels at its maximum speed, \( c \approx 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), because there are no atoms or molecules to interact with.
- In a **medium** (like glass, water, or air), light interacts with the atoms in the material, causing it to **slow down**.

The speed of light in a medium is given by:
\[
v = \frac{c}{n},
\]
where:
- \( v \): Speed of light in the medium,
- \( c \): Speed of light in vacuum,
- \( n \): Refractive index of the medium.

For glass, \( n \approx 1.5 \), so the speed of light in glass is approximately:
\[
v = \frac{c}{1.5} \approx 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

### **2. Why Does Light Slow Down?**

#### **Interaction with Atoms**
1. **Electromagnetic Wave Induces Polarization:**
   - Light is an electromagnetic wave, consisting of oscillating electric and magnetic fields.
   - When light enters a medium like glass, the electric field of the light wave interacts with the electrons in the atoms of the material.
   - These electrons absorb and re-emit the light wave as they oscillate in response to the electric field.

2. **Wave Delay:**
   - The process of absorption and re-emission introduces a **delay** in the propagation of the light wave.
   - This delay effectively reduces the speed of light as it moves through the material.

3. **Coherent Propagation:**
   - The re-emitted waves interfere constructively to form the transmitted wave.
   - This results in the light appearing to travel slower in the medium as a whole.

---

#### **Optical Density**
The **optical density** of the medium determines how much the light slows down:
- Materials with higher optical density (like glass) have a higher refractive index \( n \), meaning light travels more slowly in them.
- This is due to stronger interactions between the light wave and the material's atomic structure.

---

### **3. The Wave Perspective**
From the perspective of the **wave model** of light:
- Light in a medium propagates as a wave with a shorter **wavelength** but the same **frequency**.
- The reduction in wavelength is proportional to the refractive index:
   \[
   \lambda_{\text{medium}} = \frac{\lambda_0}{n},
   \]
   where:
   - \( \lambda_{\text{medium}} \): Wavelength in the medium,
   - \( \lambda_0 \): Wavelength in vacuum,
   - \( n \): Refractive index.

The reduced wavelength corresponds to the slower speed of light in the medium.

---

### **4. Photon Perspective**
From the perspective of **photons**:
- Photons do not physically slow down; they are absorbed and re-emitted by the atoms in the material.
- The cumulative delay from these interactions makes the overall speed of light in the medium appear slower.

---

### **5. Refraction: Changing Speed and Direction**
When light transitions from one medium to another (e.g., air to glass), its speed changes:
- As the speed changes, the light bends at the interface between the two media, a phenomenon known as **refraction**.
- The amount of bending is determined by the refractive indices of the two media:
   \[
   n_1 \sin \theta_1 = n_2 \sin \theta_2,
   \]
   where:
   - \( \theta_1 \): Angle of incidence,
   - \( \theta_2 \): Angle of refraction,
   - \( n_1, n_2 \): Refractive indices of the media.

---

### **6. Key Takeaways**
- Light slows down in glass because of interactions between the light wave and the material's atomic structure.
- The **refractive index** \( n \) quantifies how much light slows down in a medium.
- The process involves absorption and re-emission of light by atoms, leading to a cumulative delay.
