To account for relativistic effects from **Observer 2's perspective** as **Observer 1** approaches with velocity \( v_1 \), we must incorporate special relativity principles. The key factors that come into play are:

1. **Relativistic Mass Increase**:
   As \( v_1 \) approaches the speed of light (\( c \)), the effective mass of Observer 1 increases.

2. **Time Dilation**:
   Observer 1â€™s time slows down relative to Observer 2.

3. **Relativistic Centripetal Force**:
   The relativistic modifications to orbital motion arise due to the increased effective mass of Observer 1 and adjustments to the velocity-dependent factors.

Hereâ€™s how we derive the relativistic relationship between \( v_1 \), \( r \), and the gravitational field.

---

### **Relativistic Mass Increase**
The relativistic mass of Observer 1 as perceived by Observer 2 is:
\[
m_\text{rel} = \frac{m_1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v_1^2}{c^2}}}
\]
where:
- \( m_1 \): Rest mass of Observer 1.
- \( v_1 \): Orbital velocity.
- \( c \): Speed of light.

---

### **Relativistic Centripetal Force**
The centripetal force required for circular motion, accounting for relativistic effects, is:
\[
F_\text{centripetal} = \frac{m_\text{rel} \cdot v_1^2}{r}
\]

Substituting \( m_\text{rel} \):
\[
F_\text{centripetal} = \frac{m_1 \cdot v_1^2}{r \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v_1^2}{c^2}}}
\]

---

### **Relativistic Gravitational Force**
The gravitational force remains:
\[
F_\text{gravity} = \frac{G \cdot m_1 \cdot m_2}{r^2}
\]

---

### **Equating Forces for Stable Orbit**
For a stable relativistic orbit, the centripetal force equals the gravitational force:
\[
\frac{m_1 \cdot v_1^2}{r \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v_1^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{G \cdot m_1 \cdot m_2}{r^2}
\]

Cancel \( m_1 \) (assuming \( m_1 \neq 0 \)) and simplify:
\[
\frac{v_1^2}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v_1^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{G \cdot m_2}{r}
\]

---

### **Solving for \( v_1^2 \)**
Square both sides to eliminate the square root:
\[
v_1^4 = \left( \frac{G \cdot m_2}{r} \right)^2 \cdot \left( 1 - \frac{v_1^2}{c^2} \right)
\]

Expand:
\[
v_1^4 + \frac{v_1^4}{c^2} = \left( \frac{G \cdot m_2}{r} \right)^2
\]

Factorize \( v_1^4 \):
\[
v_1^4 \left( 1 + \frac{1}{c^2} \right) = \left( \frac{G \cdot m_2}{r} \right)^2
\]

Solve for \( v_1^2 \):
\[
v_1^2 = \frac{\left( \frac{G \cdot m_2}{r} \right)^2}{1 + \frac{1}{c^2}}
\]

---

### **Key Results**
1. **Relativistic Orbital Velocity**:
   The orbital velocity accounting for relativistic effects is:
   \[
   v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{\left( \frac{G \cdot m_2}{r} \right)^2}{1 + \frac{1}{c^2}}}
   \]

2. **High-Velocity Limit**:
   - As \( v_1 \to c \), the denominator grows larger, reducing \( v_1 \) compared to the classical case.
   - Relativistic effects prevent \( v_1 \) from exceeding \( c \), even in the presence of strong gravitational fields.

3. **Relativistic Modifications**:
   - The orbital velocity decreases slightly compared to the classical value due to time dilation and mass increase effects.

---

### **Example Calculation**
For Earth and a satellite:
- \( m_2 = 5.972 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} \) (Earthâ€™s mass),
- \( G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2} \),
- \( r = 7 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} \).

Classical \( v_1 \):
\[
v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{G \cdot m_2}{r}} \approx 7.5 \, \text{km/s}.
\]

Relativistic corrections would slightly lower this value, but the effect is negligible at low velocities.
