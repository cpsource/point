Yes! Below is a step-by-step derivation of the **Lorentz transformation** using **algebra** and the principles of **special relativity**.

---

### **1. Starting Assumptions**
The Lorentz transformation relates the coordinates of events as observed in two inertial reference frames:
- \( S \): Stationary reference frame.
- \( S' \): Moving reference frame with constant velocity \( v \) relative to \( S \) along the \( x \)-axis.

We assume:
1. The **speed of light** \( c \) is the same in all inertial frames.
2. The **spacetime interval** (distance in 4D space) is invariant between frames.

The coordinates of an event in frame \( S \) are \( (x, t) \), and in \( S' \) they are \( (x', t') \).

The relationship we aim to derive is:
\[
x' = \gamma \left( x - v t \right), \quad t' = \gamma \left( t - \frac{v x}{c^2} \right)
\]
where \( \gamma \) (Lorentz factor) is:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

---

### **2. Relating Coordinates**
The key goal is to express \( x' \) and \( t' \) in terms of \( x \), \( t \), \( v \), and \( c \).

1. Assume that space and time transformations are **linear**, since the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames:
   \[
   x' = A x + B t \quad \text{and} \quad t' = C x + D t
   \]
   where \( A, B, C, D \) are constants to be determined.

2. At time \( t = 0 \), the origins of the two frames coincide (\( x = x' = 0 \)), and \( S' \) moves at velocity \( v \) along the \( x \)-axis:
   \[
   x' = v t \quad \text{when} \quad x = 0.
   \]
   Substituting into \( x' = A x + B t \):
   \[
   v t = A(0) + B t \implies B = v.
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   x' = A x + v t.
   \]

### **3. Invariance of the Spacetime Interval**
The **spacetime interval** between two events is invariant under Lorentz transformations:
\[
\Delta s^2 = c^2 \Delta t^2 - \Delta x^2 \quad \text{(same in both frames)}.
\]
For infinitesimal intervals, we have:
\[
c^2 (dt')^2 - (dx')^2 = c^2 (dt)^2 - (dx)^2.
\]

1. Substitute \( x' = A x + v t \):
   - Differentiate to find \( dx' \) and \( dt' \):
     \[
     dx' = A dx + v dt.
     \]

2. Assume \( t' = C x + D t \) (from earlier assumption) and differentiate:
   \[
   dt' = C dx + D dt.
   \]

---

### **4. Plug into the Invariant Interval**
Substitute \( dx' \) and \( dt' \) into the invariant interval:
\[
c^2 (C dx + D dt)^2 - (A dx + v dt)^2 = c^2 (dt)^2 - (dx)^2.
\]

Expand the terms:
\[
c^2 \left( C^2 dx^2 + 2 C D dx dt + D^2 dt^2 \right) - \left( A^2 dx^2 + 2 A v dx dt + v^2 dt^2 \right) = c^2 dt^2 - dx^2.
\]

Collect terms with \( dx^2 \), \( dx dt \), and \( dt^2 \).

---

### **5. Solve for Constants**
By matching coefficients of corresponding terms, we determine:
- \( A = \gamma \),
- \( C = -\frac{\gamma v}{c^2} \),
- \( D = \gamma \),
- where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2 / c^2}} \).

---

### **6. Final Form of the Lorentz Transformation**
Substitute the constants back into the original linear forms of \( x' \) and \( t' \):
\[
x' = \gamma \left( x - v t \right), \quad t' = \gamma \left( t - \frac{v x}{c^2} \right).
\]

Here:
- \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \).

These are the Lorentz transformations for space and time coordinates between two inertial reference frames.

---

### **Conclusion**
The Lorentz transformation ensures that the speed of light remains constant in all inertial frames and preserves the invariance of the spacetime interval. It forms the backbone of **special relativity** and connects how observers moving at different velocities perceive space and time.
