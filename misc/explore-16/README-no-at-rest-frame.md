This is a profound question that touches on the nature of **mass** in special relativity, the role of **relative motion**, and the quest for an "at-rest" or absolute frame. Letâ€™s explore this carefully:

---

## **1. Is Mass a Function of Frame Velocity?**
In **special relativity**:
- The **rest mass** (\( m_0 \)) of an object is **invariant**, meaning it does not depend on the frame of reference. Itâ€™s an intrinsic property of the object.
- The **relativistic mass** (\( m \)) increases with velocity relative to an observerâ€™s frame:
   \[
   m = \gamma m_0 = \frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}},
   \]
   where:
   - \( m_0 \) is the rest mass.
   - \( v \) is the velocity of the object relative to the observer.
   - \( c \) is the speed of light.
   - \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor.

From the perspective of an observer, as an object moves faster:
- The relativistic mass \( m \) **appears to increase** because the objectâ€™s energy increases with velocity.
- But the rest mass \( m_0 \) stays constant.

So yes, **relativistic mass** is a function of velocity relative to a given frame:
\[
m_{\text{rel}} = f(\text{frame-velocity}).
\]

---

## **2. What Happens in the "At-Rest" Frame?**
In the objectâ€™s **own rest frame**:
- The velocity \( v = 0 \), so the Lorentz factor \( \gamma = 1 \).
- The relativistic mass \( m \) equals the rest mass \( m_0 \):
   \[
   m_{\text{rel}} = \gamma m_0 = m_0 \text{ when } v = 0.
   \]
- The object has no kinetic energy in this frame, but it **still has rest energy**:
   \[
   E_{\text{rest}} = m_0 c^2.
   \]

Thus, you **cannot eliminate mass entirely** by finding the "at-rest" frame. The rest mass \( m_0 \) is fundamental and **nonzero** for any object with mass.

---

## **3. Why You Donâ€™t Have Zero Mass in Any Frame**
If an object had **zero mass** in its own rest frame:
- It would have no **rest energy** (\( E_{\text{rest}} = 0 \)).
- The object would effectively **not exist** in the classical sense.

However, objects like photons (particles of light) do have **zero rest mass**, but they always move at the speed of light \( c \) and never have a rest frame.

For objects with nonzero rest mass (\( m_0 > 0 \)):
- The rest mass **cannot be eliminated** or reduced to zero, no matter what frame you observe it from.
- Any observer moving at any velocity relative to the object will always measure its rest mass \( m_0 \).

---

## **4. Relativistic Energy Perspective**
To clarify why rest mass remains in any frame:
The total energy of an object is:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = \gamma m_0 c^2 = \sqrt{(p c)^2 + (m_0 c^2)^2}.
\]
- When \( v = 0 \) (in the rest frame), the energy is purely rest energy:
   \[
   E_{\text{rest}} = m_0 c^2.
   \]
- For moving objects, energy includes both rest energy and relativistic kinetic energy.

No matter the frame of reference:
- **Rest energy** is always present for objects with rest mass \( m_0 > 0 \).
- The concept of "zero mass" would require \( m_0 = 0 \), which only applies to massless particles like photons.

---

## **5. Is There a "True At-Rest Frame"?**
In relativity:
- There is **no universal rest frame** or absolute reference frame.
- Motion is always **relative** to another frame of reference.
- Even if you find a frame where you are "at rest," someone else moving relative to you will observe you as having velocity and energy.

Thus:
- You can always define a **local rest frame** where your velocity \( v = 0 \) and \( m_{\text{rel}} = m_0 \).
- However, this does not mean you lose your rest mass; the rest mass \( m_0 \) remains invariant.

---

## **6. Summary**
1. **Relativistic Mass** (\( m \)) depends on the velocity relative to a given frame:
   \[
   m_{\text{rel}} = \frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}.
   \]
2. In the objectâ€™s **own rest frame**, velocity \( v = 0 \) and relativistic mass equals rest mass \( m_0 \):
   \[
   m_{\text{rel}} = m_0.
   \]
3. Rest mass \( m_0 \) is a **fundamental property** of an object and cannot be eliminated.
4. There is no **absolute rest frame** in the universe; motion is always relative.

So while relativistic mass depends on the frame, rest mass \( m_0 \) does not. There is **no frame** where you have **zero mass** if your rest mass is nonzero. ðŸš€

Would you like me to demonstrate with specific examples or explore how this applies to photons and massless particles?
