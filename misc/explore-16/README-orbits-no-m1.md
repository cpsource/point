If we eliminate \( m_1 \) (the mass of the orbiting object) from the calculations and focus only on \( v_1 \) (orbital velocity), we can derive the relationship based solely on \( v_1 \), \( r \) (orbital radius), and \( m_2 \) (mass of the central object):

### **Step-by-Step Derivation**

1. **Gravitational Force**:
   \[
   F_\text{gravity} = \frac{G \cdot m_1 \cdot m_2}{r^2}
   \]

2. **Centripetal Force**:
   \[
   F_\text{centripetal} = \frac{m_1 \cdot v_1^2}{r}
   \]

3. **Equilibrium Condition**:
   For a stable orbit:
   \[
   F_\text{centripetal} = F_\text{gravity}
   \]
   Substituting:
   \[
   \frac{m_1 \cdot v_1^2}{r} = \frac{G \cdot m_1 \cdot m_2}{r^2}
   \]

4. **Cancel \( m_1 \)**:
   Since \( m_1 \) appears on both sides of the equation:
   \[
   \frac{v_1^2}{r} = \frac{G \cdot m_2}{r^2}
   \]

5. **Simplify**:
   Multiply through by \( r \) to isolate \( v_1^2 \):
   \[
   v_1^2 = \frac{G \cdot m_2}{r}
   \]

6. **Final Relationship**:
   Taking the square root:
   \[
   v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{G \cdot m_2}{r}}
   \]

---

### **Key Insights**
- \( v_1 \) depends only on \( G \) (gravitational constant), \( m_2 \) (mass of the central object), and \( r \) (radius of the orbit).
- \( m_1 \) does not influence the velocity because the gravitational force scales directly with \( m_1 \), and so does the centripetal force, canceling \( m_1 \) from the equation.

---

### **Example Calculation**
For a small satellite orbiting Earth (\( m_2 = 5.972 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} \)):
- Gravitational constant: \( G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \text{kg}^{-1} \text{s}^{-2} \).
- Orbital radius: \( r = 7,000 \, \text{km} = 7 \times 10^6 \, \text{m} \).

\[
v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{(6.674 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot (5.972 \times 10^{24})}{7 \times 10^6}}
\]
\[
v_1 \approx 7.5 \, \text{km/s}.
\]

---

### **What This Means**
- As \( r \) increases, \( v_1 \) decreases proportionally to \( 1 / \sqrt{r} \).
- The orbital velocity depends only on the central mass (\( m_2 \)) and the orbital radius.
